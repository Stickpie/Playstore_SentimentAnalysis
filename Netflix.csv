You are able to set up your own personal queue. The only drawback is that foreign language films are not marked with a warning. We have been disappointed a couple of times starting a movie and then finding out it is not in English. You should be able to choose English Only. Otherwise Great.Looking for the most talked about TV shows and movies from the around the world? Theyre all on Netflix.

My issue with this application are the lack of controls during playback. There is no reason not to have touch controls on either side andor center. Volume updown seeking (center) brightness updown.

Also Im in my profile in the app but its casting as my partners profile to the TV. No obvious place to submit a bug report. Stops playback periodically to demand I hit the play button to continue watch. Which is an on purpose feature that I have hated forever.
