Quite fun game lots of clothes and things to do in there with dolls. You can make your own movies and make friends with other NPCs in game.

Gacha life is the most creative game I have seen. Im sad that gacha club is here because this means you wont update this game anymore. BUT! You can create ocs and put them in different poses there is also different backgrounds!

Dont believe all the gacha heat and all the bad names on this game. There are just brainless trolls trying to ruin a simple roleplay dress up game. But Id like the developer to fix some presets which they made. Most of them look very inappropriate with high amount of blush on their face. Many people would find that as a concern too. This game is nothing inappropriate except for some poses faces and presets. Thats all I love the game.

The animated poses to stop at first and then start moving but they do stop every 5 seconds. Decided to stop using the animated poses and mouths also bc I dint figure out how the animations move when I go took edits. The speech box also tends to change my words and mess things up a bunch causing to spend 5 minutes trying to fix one or two words.

I think Gacha Life is incredibly appropriate for little kids and others above 18 I recommend it would stay as a great and good game for the future and for others who are born in that time of the year.

Gacha Life should be for 5 incase the youngers dont know what theyre doing and make Gacha Heat. Indeed I think Gacha Heat should stop for the matters of its failing Gacha Life as it is a good game already and doesnt need anything much more worse than ruining the Gacha Community Hannahs ct

Its a really great game! One thing that I dont like about it is the new update where Lunime took away skintone colors. It stops me from making a couple of outfits. But other than that its a really good game.
Hello Lunime. I Love this game. I just made my first little gacha short and I have a suggestion. What if people could share their studio saves on an online server. And I want more slots on the studio save. This game is great and I want more things. YouTube Channel is LarsaFGaming GD.
I love this game. Im playing the game since 2018 bc a friend showed it me and now I cant stop playing it. Its really fun too customer you own character and maybe make edits with it or storys. Sadly little kids doing head with and thats not okay. I hope it will have a end soon)
I would like for maybe the old gacha life back at least some of the mouths clothes face accories and poses? Like the stuff in version 9 That would be much appreciated. Over all great game i love it ive played it for over 23 years! Thank you for your time and reading this.

For the positives I really appreciate that when theres going to be an add They inform you about it at the bottom of your screen. For the Negatives all I would say is could say is could you please add more backgrounds for your character. Other than that its a brilliant game! shirts hairstyles

Its super great! But however I dont like the updated version. Because Im not on an android device its very hard to download the old version. They removed a lot of mouths and some poses. But over all pretty good!

I loved the pose and its not gacha hat also thank you for the update. People still make heat but you tried your best. Please add more
I like the app I just hate the update. For example the mouths dont really look as good as they did the face accessories etc. I like the old Gacha life way better. But overall I guess its a pretty good apo to play and Id reccomend it.
Its pretty fun how you can create your own character and things but you should add realistic features to gacha life like hands different hair shades realistic eyes and the colors abs i guess. It would be easier.

So Gacha life to be honest this game seems pretty lackluster to somone who always plays gacha club but it is full of memorys for me when i used to play it.

I love this game and its been so fun and its got loads of O.Cs to make I have played it for 3 years now the skit maker though is really cool but I wish you could have more slides to do and more characters to add or give studio mode more slides too. Apart from that its a really good game

I Love everything but the only problem is that you dont have a green screen I would love it way better . I like is more than gacha life . Be honest guys you can wave is hair make it be able to blink and a lot more 55!!!

I downloaded gacha club and its such a glow up from gacha life but it does freeze on me alot and make my phone Flicker so I play gacha life because I have no problem its just can you please add more poses and maybe different blush and adjusts? Please!? Itd be dream come true for me and my gacha channel. Thank you and I highly recommend getting this app if u cant have gacha club !

The thing i appriciate is that he upgraded the things people use for heat or inappropriet content yet there are a few more things i pointed out. Some things in gacha club are racist and actually condoning heat so i think the developer caused this. Correct me if im wrong but that is unnacceptable and should be removed.
I love it! But the only thing is... the PANTS cuz the one the...strip and panties yall gacha dont have it.. but luv it man and you can play mini games and create your own character i love it so much and you can make your own story of gacha life and vids and you can open presents love it man!!!

It can get a little boring but I always come back to it. I do hope that it gets some more updates please. But the real reason I didnt give it a 5 star rating is because after awhile there is never anything new so as I said before please get some updates but please dont change how it is set up. But it a really good game.

So I was making a character and choosing the colour for the clothes when I realised the colours that looked like skin colour was not x ( because when you do the colour for the clothes the ones that look like skin tones are not allowed). I tried on another character and same. I hope Im the only one because it might make it possible to make inappropriate videos. But other then that the game is very nice.
This is really fun. I love making the characters and OCs. There arent that many ads also. It has games you can play with your Character(s). The only thin I really dont know what or how it is done is to save the pictures ONTO the gacha instead of taking screenshots. Other than that we good.
One time I tried to play it was just a black screen but I redownload it and it worked!! But its a good game after all just the gacha heat is out of control upgrade on the slots and laggy glitche. MESS!!!

I think its a fun game do recommend. There is a lot of ads tho. I normally play it when I have no internet. It has a few bugs here and there. Other than that nice game!
I love it so much!But fix the bugs please.Whenever I play whatever poses my characters are in when I enter they are in pose 1. Other than that the game is awesome and a must download app
Awesome Game! It is very recommened for kids who cant draw properly but want to make a story. The game has some good music graphics and character design! The only thing you could bring back are the shops or online chat. Other than that the concept is amazing for game that came out in 2018!

Nice but update ruined it. I mean I understand it but they got rid of things like clothing and poses that shouldnt have needed to be gotten rid of. The skin colors are nesscary things to be deleted but nothing else was nesscary.
Great app you can design characters as your style! It is safe in a sort of way. But really fun to play on when your bored! I would advise you to supervise your children as this app isnt 100 safe. Thank you for reading this have a nice day! Whoever is reading this!

Its really a good game but I just hate how there are adds back to back and Ill be trying to work on a video and an add will pop up and it makes it hard to get it finished but above all like I said its a really good game
This is the best game I ever played. U can dress ur character whatever u can and theres a lot of updates almost all the time! This is the best game they ever made. I love it.
this is nice you can play alot of games and you can dress your own character you can even make a minimovie (watch it first how to do it in youtube and why glitches why!!) but i still like gacha life 5 stars

It really cool if you like making animation and things like that and also if need a video idea you show making a gacha person. In my view I think its cool for many reasons and the only bad thing about the is that sometimes its forgets you make a user

Its a quite good experience for me because you can dress your characters up and make series and storys. ( Obviously ) Also you can play games too and when you win a game you get diamonds.

But the newest update kinda sucks. The devs removed some items because users of the game were using those clothing items for inappropriate reasons.. Edit This is really old and I just updated this review a bit.

I play this game a lot and make glmms with my characters the game is fun and a way to boost creativity. Although luni had to remove certain things from the game...just because of what people were Doing with those items.....you literally need to PROMISE you wont make sexualized content just to play the game. The game might get banned and some people are saying luni will go to jail if people keep creating nasty stuff like pornography and sexualised content. The way people also make fictional characters (Not gonna lie i did at some point) and ship them with invalid ships...like MHA DS AOT YKW (My hero academia

In gacha club you can make way better characters because there is way more options of clothing and hairstyles. And theres pets in gacha club wow 0 only problem in gacha Club is that when I make a character and attach a pet to it that pet will be the pet for every other character that I make so I cant have different pets for different characters But other than that these two games are awesome.

I love this game personally because I can like sit here customized on my favorite characters even make mini gacha movies and I even like gacha club that its a little bit glitchy so Id recommend to use gacha life cuz its less glitchy and it doesnt need alot of data or space

Its fun but please add more hair and clothes and I would give it 5 stars if youd add more! (If you have a lot of problems in game or bugs and stuff its probably your phone.)
The game is great itself but as you can see I only put four stars and the reason for that is I got to a point to where when I open the app its pitch black and it doesnt go away which caused me to have to delete it overall games is great
Its a fun game with mini games tons of options when making a character and overall great quality I would recommend it for anyone that just wants a fun game with lots of options

The game itself is great the graphics are good controls are good the gameplay is sometimes a bit repetitive but mostly nice however I miss the arena feature as it used to be the main aspect of the game and was the most fun part for me

Love it but after the update it made me sad I know a lot of people make gacha heat but cant you see a lot of people are trying to save the gacha community? Think about it and please put back the old ones maybe Ill put 5 star again
1010 mush customization. but can you tell people to stop making animations that are stop motion that are also synced (mind my spelling) to stop it hurts my eyes and gives me a headache

I personally love this game. Its a great way to use your imagination! I have played this game to the point that it feels like reality! This game inspired me to start my own YouTube channel! Over the past year I have became very successful. All thanks to the app! I highly recommend downloading!

Its a great fit for every age as well you can make storys with this game too the only thing I dont like about the game is that... When you press on a character in Life it can get laggy sometimes when the person talks but other than that. Great game!

Its a good game. Can be a bit buggy and glitch sometimes but otherwise I like it. Its good for when I just feel like too much and need some childish stuff.
Encountered a glitch or my phones been hacked. All the characters are set to the same random character gems are set to 999 999 level is 99 and the background changes rapidly. All that aside I love the game and I hope that its not a glitch and that my phone is just hacked. Great game .
This is a very good game and I love it! It doesnt overwhelm(?) me with options and it doesnt have too little it is the perfect game for people with creative minds although there is a little bit of lagging... But other than that best Mobil game!

I really like thos game its very creative and fun I enjoyed dressing up characters and experimenting with different customizations. ofcourse there were a few glitches but other than that this game was amazing!
Its wonderfull but i had to uninstall it because it wouldnt open the game i would try over and over but it wouldnt work i have been playing this game for atleast 4 years or so and this has never happend good game tho.
Somehow I when I download it it stopped downloading maybe because of storage but no I tried a again and it worked it has a lot of adds but its totally cool and amazing and I mean I dont like it I love it its amazing cause you can costumise your own character
Amazing game it is really fun and I love playing it. The only thing is that you can do innerpopiet things to eachother with the guns and knifes but other than that this is a very good and popular game which I enjoy I hope everyone else does too xx
I give this a four star now. Its risky no ads for me and sometimes the preset i used i edited it then when i left gacha life it reset the character to the original. Luni try to fix this problem.

Well this game is fun but theres one reason I hate it... The animations on the pictures look cool but when you want your character to do it looks different then the animation pictures.Please fix this
This game is amazing! It has almost no adss! But I really want you to make an update that has new hair and faces. The only problem is that when I dance its really glitchy. But this game is amazing I hope you make an update soon!!!!!
I love this app! I think its a great game for when you are bored. And I love making the characters! There are lots of things you can do in Gacha life and I also like how it doesnt need internet for you to play this! I give it a 4 out of 5 bec there are still a lot of adds
This game is pretty fun tbh! You can customise alot of characters play games and use your stamina other then that lets get to the glitches. For some reason sometimes every character turns into charactary? Could you maybe fix this? Thank you! D
I love this app so much!! Gacha life is an amazing app for people of all ages to get creative so they can make characters of their own and they can also create a story from the studio button! I love this app a LOT!! I 100 recommend!

This is a great game! I use this for youtube etc. But I wish there was an update to make the app more better. Like when taking screenshots for a video I want it to be like double tap to exit screen mode. Overall I love it! ) 3
This is a great game! I really perfer to get this game! There is one thing though every ten minutes it makes me watch a one minute ad. Please fix this! But anyone amazing game! In one day I got 37 6 boxes! Keep it up! Thank you for this game!
The game is amazing! It teaches you new things! And it makes you have TONS of creativity!!! But everytime I try to press the X button in dress up it wouldnt work. I dont know if its a glitch so if it is please fix it! Overall good game keep it up Luni!!
This game is amazing you can make so many cool characters and skits with it. But i feel like it should have more customization kinda like Gacha Club. Custom clothing more outfit styles more hair options (regular animal etc.) More skin tones simple stuff like that.

I find that Gacha Life is fun but can get boring and repetitive over time and I think the players should be given saved slots for skits they made so they can save 6 skits and theyd go in a folder instead of having a skit wanting to make a new skit then having to delete the old skit to make a new on...Full ReviewI find that Gacha Life is fun but can get boring and repetitive over time and I think the players should be given saved slots for skits they made so they can save 6 skits and theyd go in a folder instead of having a skit wanting to make a new skit then having to delete the old skit to make a new one.The dialoge can be repetitive

Its a good game!but something isnt right....Why does people keep making gacha whatever they call it...i hope you can fix it and for the skin colour i think you should off the skin colour even for a boythats from meand actually i could give 5 stars if the skin colour for the boys off
Amazing there is nothing wrong but I think you should make a quiz on what you make with it. And it cannot save my progress once I install it. And there is a lot of ads but other than that there is nothing wrong.

Ive loved gacha ever since Gacha Studio and just came here to ask if you could add some of the old stuff back (crouching poses push up poses the tongues and some other mouths the extra blush) because the new game Gacha Club has it and I like Gacha Life more since its more simple.

That would be really helpful besides making the new update. Also why are you not updating the others? I know I know there not THE best but not updating them!? Gosh. I have a lot of things to say Luni. And whats up with gacha club? I love gacha club! But gacha club is actually not better than this. I like this game better besides the fact that I CANT download gacha life on my tablet. God. Fix this link. Once you do all give you 4 stars.
I love this app! only complaint I have is that sometimes it just freezes up on the menu screen. Ive tried shutting down my laptop and reopening it but it just doesnt work all the time. Other than that its a really cute game.
Super cool game! I only want you to add some more stuff to customize with and plz add more slots Btw super cool game!!!!!!!! IDK what people say about ads just turn off your WIFI

( Id personally say for kids 7) Im 14 and I LOVE the game. So I sometimes search Gacha Life on google for fun but what comes up is Luni ( Lunime the creator of Gacha Life) has died or most likely Gacha Life is getting deleted ) I just want to know which one is true. Id be heartbroken if he had died or it was getting deleted because I make all my screenshots on it to make videos and things like that. And also one more negative note about the game is that I keep getting so many adverts like when Im playing a game an advert pops up immediately okay one more thing about the adverts is that when im making a character
I really love this app. But... there is one problem. There are a lot of ads. Abd i liked the old version better because inthe old version there were more mouths. Blush. But i still like it
This is the best character maker you can make a video play games and customize your character. Its really easy to use and i having no problems with this app.

My experience is amazing. you can level up go to life customize presets Play gacha games go to studio get gifts for gems and do glitches at 3AM or find a real glitch not at 3AM! The best thing WAS We use to have chat in this game till lunime deleted that future. shirts
I think its cool because you can make creative stuff with this app. You may edit it make a cute photo and stuff make your favorite cartoon character(s) yeah. But there are some bugs I hope you can delete them. Thanks developer Ill be waiting patiently for new updates shirts hairstyles

I really like this game there are so many choices of clothing hair and hats. Although this game is fun in order to make videos you have to take a lot of screen shots. This game calms you down when you are mad and is quite soothing.

This game is VERY SCARY because there are some scary glitches that when you play at 3am its so scary and when you make your own gacha person and you come back at 5 mins the gacha person talks and its REAL so you have to let them join gacha club to stop the glitch

This is a great game but the only problem is that I wish u could change the outlines of like the hair and skin...also maybe a bit more posses and able to change the hands like in gacha club? Other than that its a awesome game!

This game is so cute and adorable! We can customize our characters play mini games and earn gems! We can make stories. By far this is my favorite dressup game! Sometimes it lags but thats alright! Thank you Lunime for the best dressup game ever!
I love this game you can make your own character and you can make your own story sort of . But theres one issue that I think is common it has lots of ads sort of and maybe like you can like probably an upgrade it so you can add your friend in and more dogs and cats

This game is amazing! I give it a 5 star because you can create characters and make glmmGacha life mini movies. Also you can make them more realistic by installing ibis painting.
It is such a fun game it has such cool design options.theres also more on the games on it.but I cant give it a 5 star because there needs to be more thats why I use gacha club more. And also it is sometimes slow
It is one of the most creative and fun games Ive played. I have gachaverse and club. Me and my sister love thie game series it allows you to be creative and make characters that are like you plus more. So thank you!!33

It just closes the app. Asks to do survey. It keeps asking you. So i block the app. Resets your diamonds. And everything gets reseted so 2 ratings. And you type in class or glass which becomes a bad word but you keep typing in it you get kicked. And you have to space it. Please fix it.
Love it. This game is my mini world of creation. You can be whatever or whoever you want. I like the mini games the most. Especially picc pawket rhythm. That one is my favorite. But can you please change the Christmas image thing. Its not even Christmas.

This game is wonderful.And also we can dress them as any characters.But the reason I am giving it 4 star is because the weapons and other things are not same as the characters but I liked this game.
Its good but needs to have more itams bc it doesnt have like much but besides that its really good as in hair you can feel free to do any knowing that know one will judge you for making it and you can try make people you know in Gacha life
Okay there is one reason I dont like about this they are to many ads poping up every time you go check your other presets and i dont know why but this game is amazing i love it its fantastic keep up the good work
This game rocks! You can make your own character and pit little shoes and socks on them. I rated thus a 3 put of 5 because I think they could use some more hairs and eyes etc. I much enjoy gacha club because you can adjust things and I really recommend Gacha Club instead to be honest.

You know that the game will start dying again because of those heaters so how about to return the poses and keep the lips the same and remove those skins??

I like this game alot the music is really relaxing but there is way to many ads Im just happy that I can get ROBUX and not a scam it may take a long time to get gems but it is fun better then any other game Im starting to like this game more then Roblox its like an online figet game

Amazing game. So many outfits and creativity! Only complaint is it takes a while to install but I know they cant control that so 4 stars. If it didnt take FOREVER to install 5 stars ! It literally took half an hour to install 13!

Quite nice but the amount of things you can use to decorate your characters with feels small after a while. Good little timewaster.

This game is amazing it is so much fun and you can design any character you want but I wish you could customize your own colors and that is my opinion

so it getss boring most of the time and it has too many adds i will sugest 6 things 1 low down on the ads 2 add some merch out fits from youtubers 3 add some custum pose 4 a animate thing 5 more skirts and pose 6 make it a lower level to online export like level 3 4 or 5
Really great! It might be a teeny bit older then gacha club (which btw I recommend) it us still amaize! So many different outfits and poses it just has everything!!! Recommend it loads if you are will to make some kind of vid!
I really love this app you can create your oc play games and many more but there small slots for more characters but i really love this game its so much fun thank you Lunime for making this app!!
I really love this game and this game is like the best game ever but there is a glitch that comes out of nowhere its like when you make your characters and go into studio it makes all your characters look weird? So can you please fix that glitch but its still a good game!!!
I love this so much! Even though it has glitch sometimes but yeah! Its easy and great... i also miss the old gacha... eh! And also life is more easier than club for my opinion but some of the ppl who are used to play club and life... Were sorry luni about what happend that you at jail...

Its a really good game you can make videos with it but one problem people are still making gacha heat i caught my sister doing that on her tablet so maybe get rid of the red thing like were the black goes when the gacha OC is sad and one of the pants replace it with another set of jeans
This is a good game to play when your bored. I just wish that you guys could add more chacters to the sences. If you cant do that its okay. But i would tell other people about it to. This is really a fun game to play. I would highly recommend it to other people. Definitely 5 star rating.
3 stars for the fact I cant find a way in game to save a video of my skits ect. A friend introduxed me to it. Its cute and fun but feels a bit pointless when kt cant be shared. I get that people have used it wrongly. But some of us just want some honest fun and make honest videos with chibis...
This is an extremely fun game with codes to crack and a world to explore. There are so many options on making characters! I enjoy this app and recommend it to people who like making chibis and people who like to use posing examples or just anyone! I do miss the chat though
Very easy to play no glitches whatsoever. I love making the characters and using them for edits! I definitely think that the updates are a little hard to work with so if some of the old positions came back that would be great

Amazing game! You can dress up characters and put them in the studio! But there are some problems.. Why have the fishnets? its inappropriate. I know you wont update the game but I still dont like the fishnets.
Its a really good game I always use it fo tdd my tik tok videos! But tbh I dont really like the gacha update I understand why they did it bit I dont understand why they had to get rid of some of the poses. Very good game though!^^
They took some of the poses and face accessories so I cant do that much but overall its a very great game but plz bring back the old poses and mouths and face accessories also the little diamond cut in that one shirt was cute but now its gone! But I still love the game

The game is something to play when you have spare time. I enjoy making my own characters but there are very few items and it does tend to lag. All in all its still a good game and opens some inner creativity.

Its amazing app probably one of the best roleplay games out there. But the reason I rate it 4 is because whenever I go to studio then come back to edit my charcters there is a ad. But overall amazing game!
I love it . gacha club is good to but it annoys me because there is barely any objects you can put on the studio but gacha has a whole bunch of objects you can place.

This game is so much fun because you can make characters and do so much more play mini games design a lot. But I highly prefer gotcha club cause you can do so much more
great game just I have had the charactery glitch(I think thats its name) at least twice and I had white screen when I tried to load it once so i have had to reinstall a lot of times. still five stars! just worried about losing my characters edit Theyre fine!!

You can also make 20 characters Totally recommend it

I love the game but I absolutely hate the fact that some of the eyes have the checkered look to them and you cant remove it. I make the eyes yellow for example the purple squares are still there.
I love gacha life but they removed most of the items because of heat. Luning knew the right thing to do but I was hoping if you can add the small face again?

I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS APP! The characters that you can make are soo cute! The only reason I put 4 stars is because some of the poses have been changed. In my opinion I like the old ones better. But other than that the game is awesome.
I love this game! But it seems to simple now that Gacha Club is out. However I think this gane is better for new players in the Gacha community. This game is fun for younger grades and new players so yeah!
I absolutely love this app!! And I would definitely recommend it. But the reason I give it 4 stars is because I do wish it had more choices for the accessories and more backgrounds. But other than that it is a fantastic game!
This is a really nice game lm playing this since 2018 with my friend it was used to be amazing until gacha heat. Because of gacha heat this game got updated and there are a lot of things removed but even tho that this is so wondeful game

Hello Lunime! Lovely app! Its nice that gacha heat is gone hopefully it wont happen again there are no bug ever since I started 2 years ago I play this app whenever Im bored or if Im feeling down. I fully recommend this app if you want to design your own imagination!
I really love this app!!! But I gave it a 4(four) stars because I hope this app put a edit button just only for eyebrows eyes and mount. AND THIS APP IS FAMILYFRIENDLY LIKE KIDS OR FULLY GROWN PARENT. And second i hope to bring back the full blush and the old items too.

i love this game but it just slow for me and they kind of make this like a dating game cause cabel is just a little boy and is in love already its super crazy but if you fix him into a normal boy ill be happy very much!
This is amazing but the only problem is the update! I cant use my fav pose that I was gonna use for a vid. My phone was broken so I got a new one and downloaded it and then I couldnt use it!
Its just a really fun game for people who would like a hobby!! Gacha life allows you to create povs charicters and much more!! Gacha life has been incredible for the last 2 years!

Its a very good game but I do have my likes and dislikes. So Im going to talk about things I dislike. 1st its very glitchy every single time when I use in action pose glitches like crazy! 2nd the outfits are meh theyre cool and pretty but at the same time theyre just meh. 3rd the wallpapers are pretty cool but theyre like the outfits theyre just meh. And those are the things that I dislike. But in all I really like this game and I hope they upload more!
I really love gacha life! You can make all sorts of characters and even play fun games! But honestly i think tye best thing is going to the studio mode and making videos from it.
Its cool.but i dont like update.but i enjoyed this game. and you guys can play gacah club its so cool! and you will gat a Gold gacha tickets and have 4 mini games. and last one you can play gachaverse RPG and gacha studio. so you will play Lunime games and have (67) games ok!!

This game is super fun but I get bored in 5 or 10 minutes it gets boring but its fun and I like it but they new clothes like I like none of the clothes lol tbh there ugly but when Im bored with all my games I play gacha life

Not a gachatuber but this app really has me fascinated the colors the many cute hairstyles the mixed clothes are just PERFECT. If you need to desing new characters and create mini stories as sketches well Gacha Life Is the best option for u

I have many red flags about gacha club When i was training to be level 5 (So I can import characters and ofc for the sake of it.) I was level 4 and I was quite mad about it being hard to attack Anyways I crashed and joined the game again to find out I was level three at the beginning?. Both these apps have issues. But good overall Id say I normally make characters not a movie maker.
I love it there is so many cute accessories tails wings and a lot of other stuff to choose from.I really love making new characters in this game. some minigames too. I really love this game.Its adorable!

I really like this game but I have one problem. Could you please add more backgrounds like the backgrounds you have on Gacha Club. I dont play Gacha Club I prefer Gacha Life. But the update and the fact that there is not much background options really annoys me. Please fix this!
This app is amazing but you should remove the shadows so people cant make red shadows they make with it the thing called ( gacha heat ) and this is not for kids you should remove it for all the ages so people cant make it save gacha community
This game is AWSOME! You can be creative with Oc making AND storytelling! I enjoy watching Gachatubers make such a original story and concept with just this game. Its both simple and easy to use And the minigames are super adorable too. I RECOMMEND IT ALOT!

I mean they removed some cool stuff and somethings that are not even what they said its idk what. I want them to remove this update if they can. Old version was better honestly. Plus you cant stop some people for making wrong videos theyll find a way. Good idea would be that they put old stuff back and they can leave the poses they added now but they NEED TO GIVE US OLD VERSION. IT WAS SO MUCH BETTER.
I reallyyy... Love this game because you can make your original character(OC) and play mini game... And you make mini movie at studio you can go to life to level up and you can have friends in life and you can also buy gacha and give to friends at lives status
This game is cool but when ur offline ads come and its kinda annoying... so if you update it would really help please update it Im begging you if you do update it I will give you 5 stars bye I love this game also update it pleaseee
This is a best game I love this but the problem is that when we pick a item we cant choose what color we want can u pls make the game a better change? I mean not ever thing just the colors
Really good game the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because there isnt enough hairs clothes eyes props and I wish they would make more characters to unlock in the Life mode.
I loved the game but I started to play gacha club.The reason I started to play it is because it has a lot more outfit ideas and you can customize were you place them but Im redownloading the app to see if its still good give it a three star due to gacha heaters

So when I donloaded the app and it finished. It restarts idk if its just my internet or the game plz fix it! And when you do Ill give a 5 star review! And the fact you can change the color of the shade and bc of that theres gacha heat plz fix it so you cant do gacha heat.
Its a really good game! But I dont like all the glitches... I would love if you could fix those. Other than that 5 stars! Keep up the good work!

This game is pretty good I make my yt videos of it! But there is only one good hair color that is like brown and blond and others are just pink purple so please add more colors! Thank you
This game is awesome. Fun fact my first model for my YouTube channel is my Gacha life character. And it helped me out until I created a digital model of me instead of my first Gacha model. But still this game is amazing! Thanks Lunime!
It was good. I like to deco my characters but there is a bug in it. And do remember to add in a box for eyes like no eyes. I would like to make a robot in it.

This app is good but I dont understand how to get 2 of your characters in the same place. Also the glitches are really creepy once I made a lot of characters marinette adrien alya and nino but they became the normal ones.

Its a really fun app when it comes to no wifi. But after a while it can get boring. My favorite thing are the characters they are so cute!
Gacha life is a really fun game and theres a little bit ads and im asking if you can add more updates? Well if its you cant its ok and i want to to add more clothes and pants shoes and eyes mouths and maybe you can add eyelashes (sorry if its to much lunime)
This game is always very fun! I mostly like to make characters. The problem is the game hasnt been updated since last year and yes there is a lot of things to do in the character creator but there is really not.
Needs more hair styles and clothing and everything. And more poses. The game is fun but I wanna make the head smaller and the body bigger. Gacha Club isnt available due to issues . Please make all this happen . And maybe I will redownload it.
This game is really fun to play when your bored! Especially when there is no WiFi and we can make mini movies like I see it in YOUTUBE but the game is very fun to play.
I love this game I can create my own OCs and make stories with them! The presets are amazing as well I love the life mode to get to M u u I recommend having a journal on you to keep track on the code.
Its really good but they need to put new more clothes and more hair and more shoes and more socks and pants But its really good its so nice that I play it all day well sometimes
This game is awesome! But i hate people who started to be gacha heaters. But mine is not! I love gacha! by the way In youtube i watched gachatube! And yeah i like Charlottes voice though. Shes pretty and she talks anything! I like this game!
I love this game!You can choose presets to use you can make your own characters there are also mini games you can play!you can even do skits and can create things in the studio!I really like doing the life in this game!
Very good game so many characters to make so many cool things can keep me busy for 5 hours. Theres this bug so it will not let me chat in any character can you fix it causenminutes ago I had to restart my tablet because of it but now its happening again
Its not a bad game I enjoy it a lot! you can make ur own movies and have fun with friends! There is just one thing I wish they added more clothes hats shoes etc

But the poses are deleted so i gave it a 45 but this game is hugely good. Try more gamemodes that would be cool right lmao ..................and more characters and slots! That would be amazing am i correct
I fing hate little kids and how they ruined this game. It was better with all the clothing mouths and color options but now its just restricted and sorry to say this but its a bit Lame.. Nonetheless good job Luni I like the game still )

This game is really fun but I just wish it was like gacha club so I could get better poses and make my character wear more stuff to make it cooler. Overall I think this game Is really fun.
This game is fun! You can create characters but Im not in love with the shirts because the jackets are connected to the shirts and I think that you should make the jackets seperate I like this game a lot!
Lovely game but theres a few bugs so when I exit the game my character doesnt save at all when I play would be a bit of ads but its k. Other than that its a great game! Just needs a bit of fixing up and I might give this rating a 5 stars!
I adore this app! Although every time I type something with my keyboard the app completely exits! Please fix it! I wanna make lits of sweet names for my characters but I cant because of the glitch.
This game is a really fun game! I used to own it (Its not my taste anymore) and I loved it! Its a good way for people to be creative and such. The only flaw is the adds may sometimes lag the game a bit but thats an easy fix. Its an all around good game and I do suggest getting it! )
Great! I only wish that you could change both of your eyes. And on my previous device it wouldnt let me play but great game
I like the actions it looks like its real but in a cartoon version. Nice hairstyles. I recommend that you should maybe add just a bit more actions though. This game has ads but at least very few. This a cool game.
Its a really good game ) but I have 1 question I think you have to update the game because some people are playing gacha club like 12 years but there still level 1... especially me Ive been playing it like 34 months and Im still at level 1 so can u fix it anyways amazing game
Its a really good game its just that when I first started I was dressing up luni then it would just let me have the colors that are similar to skin color like gacha heat but I still dont use it I think its a bug.
Love it! I can crate characters with a variety of things to choose from! This deserves 6 stars but only if I could put that many! But I do think you could add some more accessories and other stuff like that. Otherwise AMAZING!
I dont like the thing in the beginning and you should mack more options in clothing(overall its a good game to make videos or just to dress up characters)
Ok this is an awesome game the only thing is it needs a bit more things gacha club is super glitchy and it has a lot of selection but gacha life is not glitchy at all but it does not have every thing that gacha club has so what Im trying to say is I want gacha life to have a good selection like ga...Full ReviewOk this is an awesome game the only thing is it needs a bit more things gacha club is super glitchy and it has a lot of selection but gacha life is not glitchy at all but it does not have every thing that gacha club has so what Im trying to say is I want gacha life to have a good selection like gacha club has but anyway this game is still pretty good so ya please get gacha life in stead of gacha club.

What a great game! It keep me interested and I enjoy making videos and its not like the games that give you multiple ads!!Your abele to take ur creations and put them in charctrers.I think you should definitely take a look! Anyway lets go!!
love the game but I wish there more color plattes and I dont like when u leave the game during making a oc and when I come back it doesnt save but whatever its still good so keep the up the good work
Gacha life is an amazing game. Although Luni has removed some things it is still useable and its one of y favorite games. You can dress up your characters to look however you wish. Just do not do gacha heat because this is a childrens game.

its sooooo cool! i love creating characters and dressing them up! but the only thing wrong is that it doesnt save the character(s) when you uninstall the app and get it back
Well it is good for making skits the style of it is really good! Its has way more props then gacha club so yeah. Btw can they make a update some how you can stop the lagging animation? I would love that thanks!
THIS IS AMAZING!! i make tiktok videos with gacha life and gacha club ! Its pretty fun to play ! Played this for 2 years and still not over it!!!!! If i could i would rate this a 1010 ! Totally recommended
Love this game so much I found out about it when I was 8 by a youtuber this is a amazing game . The committee is horrible sometimes some times the character can be sexualized or you can get a matching skin tone but over all this is a amazing games love it so much

This is an amazing game! There are a few ads but they are normally really short! I totally recommend this game for all ages!

(You can play gacha life on Phone tablet(Ipad) And laptop Or computer and dont worry its Virus Free!) shirts hairstyles

But dont play the game at 300 a.m. if you do there there will be like going to put creepy stuff in 300 a.m. Thats just scary that what I hate that why I put 3.

I like it a lot but please update it more o keep having trouble though but its a good game you can make your own character and all that stuff but you really need to fix it though have a nice day ^_^
Love the game so much you can make your character anything you want it to be like plus you can explore places and play games and get gems and you can also turn of the music if you want and plenty of YouTubers use this app so hopefully you play this game have a nice day
Very fun two common glitches. Other then that though it super fun for gachatubers and gacha tiktokers and other people who just want to play ). Totally recomend!
I love this game so much but... It would really really make my day if you made a second one gacha Life 2 I was thinking more character slots new poses and outfits more backgrounds new accessories eyes maybe you could add socks and the socks you can use skin color so you should add fishnets plsss )

I really love this app This is better than gacha club But some ppl saying They say this app is scary and there are glitches that are scary and They are still making a tutorial to work. The scary glitch that I tried but it doesnt work. Gacha life is that true?
I love this app so much!!!!some things have change that i loved about the app.like you can now only yous surten colors.and they got rid of some blushes.they got rid of some poses And some other stuff. But i really think that you shoud get this app
This game is great. I used this for 2 yrs and still i havent get bored my suggestion is this should have a free screen shot without premium ofc bcz i struggle alot on taking screen shot because they see my status bar and it bothered me alot. Thank you.
Im thinking of making Tiktoks I would use gacha club but this app is so simple and easy gacha club has more but is confusing and hard to use Coz you have to colour more things change alot of stuff ect gacha life is the one for Me )
I love it! The dressing the Roleplaying! You can make amazing Characters! Its the best game ive ever played! uwu ... that was in 2020 Its now 2021! I apologise for saying uwu im shocked and scared. the game is pretty fun tho ( 3
Its nice that you get to create your own characters and do whatever you want and you could even go play and its kind of scary that you can but I make cool things with those demon eyes but I really love the game Im going to give this game a 5star rating God bless the game and God bless the Creato...Full ReviewIts nice that you get to create your own characters and do whatever you want and you could even go play and its kind of scary that you can but I make cool things with those demon eyes but I really love the game Im going to give this game a 5star rating God bless the game and God bless the Creator
YESSSS Amazing app I always play this app when I first got the app I didnt really know what to do with this app then I just went and change the charter and my mind was blown I was amazed i saw so many options and a the end I loved My charter soooooooo much this app is AMAZING 5 stars 4 life!!!!
I love this game but it has to many ads it gives me time to think on what pose to do and what clothes to put on my characters I lovw this game sooooo much thank you for creating this game!!!!!!!!
I love this game so much!!! Theres a lot of things you can do you can design your characters and you can make a video. Ive been playing this for like 4yrs i think and im very addicted lol. The best game )
I love it so much you can make your own characters in the game and get gem collect cool items and the characters are so cute good game for anywhere
Um hi I love the app but there are a phew things thats wrong with the appokay so first off you look for a animation ant touch it it will do it but its like kinda stoping you know and second can you add more back rounds and last of all when I watch YouTube there are faces no I mean mouths there is ...Full ReviewUm hi I love the app but there are a phew things thats wrong with the appokay so first off you look for a animation ant touch it it will do it but its like kinda stoping you know and second can you add more back rounds and last of all when I watch YouTube there are faces no I mean mouths there is one that is stiling the tongue out and so much other faces so please upgrad or add the faces n the game and make the animation not stop for a little please if you can I will give you a five starrating
Its a great app I love it but today I tried getting into it to design my characters more and when I click the continue or confirm thing in the beginning it just took me to a white screen. I tried waiting it out but idk what is happening.
I like the game but there is one issue my character was not standing up straight but I will recommend do get this game this game is a really good game and it is very fun if you want to dress up characters
It is very fun and cool! Like i can create characters with my creativity. But theres gacha heat when they are literally little kids playing and seing this which is not for children and it inspire them to do and their parents see this.
I love this game you can make your own characters you even have a studio also you can play games and explore thorough city town beach and school
This game is really fun other than the glitches and alot of ads its a really fun game to play I personally love making little mini movies for me and my friends to watch. I definitely recommend this game for you if your into roleplaying and customizing and if your into that then is game suits you.
A boredom game to play for example make cute characters and make story editing etc... I hate the ad when Im in the middle of finding some stuff it annoy me so much that why I gave it 4 star but I love the game so much! Cure my boredom.
I love this game! The only reason I didnt give it a 5 star is bc they took away some of the good poses and avatar things. But other then that its a really good game! )
Love this app!!but sometimes when I play it becomes laggy and after the lag a ad will pop up so it ruins my play so thats all love this app!
Its nice and relaxing to play. U like to create characters from movies that I watch and they tend to have a quite good option choice but it sometimes feels like they have soo many options but no variety mainly in the hair options
I love dress up games and Ive always loved Gacha Life but now its not as entertaining. Use to it was about playing with and making friends. Its just really not what it use to be.

Gacha life is a classic Ive been playing this game for a long time and its pretty good the problem is not the much features but doing good game the good thing is its easy to use perfect for beginners.
Its amazing I love to create edits all that but sometimes it wont let me get back home thats the problem and the other one is that when I leave and make a character it changes to the normal character I made that I didnt like so fix those 2 problems ty
Its really cool I always make cool characters and cute ones too! Really creative game! But I get really scared sometimes about the glitches and I dont often use this app sometimes cause I usually use Roblox. But play this game its really cool!
Its great love it but can yall update skits like give a choice to choose different clothing in skits because its hard to make a good skit also 5 more slots for characters because I have a lot of characters I love a dont want to change them ive never had I problem with adds tho I hardly see them ...Full ReviewIts great love it but can yall update skits like give a choice to choose different clothing in skits because its hard to make a good skit also 5 more slots for characters because I have a lot of characters I love a dont want to change them ive never had I problem with adds tho I hardly see them so it needs a four till we are able to change clothes in skits because I have a skit Im making and cant change their style also more characters to skits will be awesome to see in the future.
Its a fun game I highly recommend it but usually it crashes and sometimes when I try to move a character I always press reset characters Still its a great game
I love this game so much!But theres a problem The gacha farts and gacha heat are ruining the community and can u add a little bit more stuff likeonline games new things like chlotse talk whit friends...Yeah bye yall have a great time! 3
So hello i really love this app but ads are just to annoying so yeah there are some glitches when I go out of the game my avatar isnt there for some reason so can you please fix the glitch

this app is amazing but i would suggest to add more hairstyles and clothes and also please add more accessories and shoes just to make it more fun but i also suggest for you to add the old accessories its really sad that you removed the old ones thats all thank you this app is amazing tbh
Ive been in love with gacha ever since Gacha studio. This game is so amazing. Just like gacha club! I do however prefer this game because of the simple designs. But Im so glad even at age 14 that this game has impacted my childhood.
Okay This game is Actually awesome..a cute Creative one... And there arent any ads that always popping out..I really recommend this to everyone who loves cute chibis also it would be better if you add more Clothings and accessories we would highly appreciate it
Okay so. I LOVE this app. But the thing is there are a lot of ads. I mean you could make half of a character and then an ad comes up. Its fine to be honest just a little annoying.
Honestly this app is amazing. And so was the update! People are complaining alot but I dont really see why because the update was put into action because of sexual content anyways this app is just amazing! Thanks! Edit i remember when this games content was good
Wow its so cute on eye outfits and etc your doing great luni but... somethings is problem when i close gacha apps my oc is gone .... i mean what i do with my oc it will change and i hope you can fix it
It was so cute! Easy to play fun to use great time killer! Its something I use often and I love making stuff with the Skit Maker and Studio.
I love this game its great BUT it can get glichy and crash so yeah it is good but still you need to fix it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is a great app I love the different oufit choices but there arent as many as there should be there are alot of glitches and long ads but throw that away its a great app!

So I love the way you can change your characters clothes and its so much fun but it can be bad for kids sometimes it is a really fun game like I said but it can be bad for kids but it can be fun for kids teens and grown ups so I give the game gacha life a 5
It is the best game ever if you havent downloaded it yet then what are u doing u should go download it right now! u can play games and make your own characters and you dont have to buy anything you can make cool stories and it is free so go ahead and download this. D yass queen
I used to play this game as a kid. Its really fun but annoying adds pop up randomly and its really bugging me.But i love the minigames. It doesnt have much hairs and accesories than gacha club but i still enjoy this because its very cartoony and happy.
Amazing app! This deserves 5 stars for sure! But I have a small question could you take the old gacha back? Or is it not allowed anymore? If you could change it it would be amazing but it probably wouldnt...but its still amazing!
I like how this game has different outfits that you can use and how you can change the characters and use your imagination I think its a really good game for teens like me but i hate how you theres always a add here and there and its a little to kidlike for me
Fun. And amazing... I hate the fact that I get random adds though its gets really annoying after awhile... But over 5 star!!
This game is really nice! The only problem that I have with this game is whenever I try to put class or glasses it puts hashtags over the bad word can you please fix this but overall this is a really good game!
This game is amazing in all ways! You get to dress up people and play fun mini games. I dont really know what else to put but it is good for quite a verity of ages!

This game is awesome! I really enjoy playing it but the only thing i dont like is that u are limited with clothes and u cannot customize your own (. Otherwise its a really good game.
I Love Gacha Life Honestly But...The new update is pretty ugly beacause your not putting affort in posses and some of the skin colors I was using for cute outfits But you took that away from me But luckly I can get it back
This is great Its a amazing app to make storys movies tiktoks and more!I just would like it to allow moving hairs faces accs and yea shirts
Great game! You can dress up characters play mini games get levels and much more! If your a animevideo game fan you will absolutely love this game! Thank you lunime for creating this game!!

This app is amazing. I love it! I would say i have a problem with how you took away certain things but it was for the best to try and stop people from making innapropite content. And honestly I dont mind it!
I love this game so much! Theres alot of characters and outfits! But this is why i give it 4 stars because of the ads when i accidentally open my wifi and what i hate the most is the GACHA HEAT like SERIOUSLY Its so disgusting!!So please report and fix it!

I like gacha club and gacha life a lot! But I would also like to recommend that they add the gacha life emotes to the gacha club emotes so you can have to same emotes on both! If yall could do that it would be awesome!
Great Game! Barrely any ads. I just wish you could add more hair clothing etc. And I wish you could upddate it every 2 3 months for holdidays. s. Bai now! .
Honestly I literally love gacha. Its so cute and I play it all the time! You can design character play games for gems and make glmm (Gacha life mini movies) with studio! I would 10000010 recommend this!

This game is the best game out of the gotcha life games its almost like the videos but you could only put two characters in one place ( please make it a little better and let more than two characters in one place then Ill give it a five star please and thank you

This game is really good for kids and teens however I really like the way it looks like the faces are amazing I really love it and also sometimes it glitchs I really hate it but its really nice for teens and kids love the creator
Its amazing game! Ive played this game for months. Its just that its too plain. And too many adds. And tyeres not a lot choices to picj clothes. I would recomend update it every single year or month
I love how you have more options to make your characters with than GachaVerse! Also the music makes this game 100 better than if it had music like from GachaVerse or Gacha Studio
Its a really good game!!but maybe add a few more outfits and hair styles ) but this game is absolutely amazing!!I recommend playing this game
This game is great its a little slow and when you go to life and try to make friends then you cant get to level 10 so the do not become your friend so that I wish theyd fix that but those are the only problem

Its very cool game it does not cost any money I just wish it didnt have any ads you can make your character with props clothes and different colors of hair this game is pretty amazing
Gacha life is like a dream home that you can come to your place and make many things to yourself they are glitches but you dont have to do that if you want so....... just enjoy it
I have a lot of fun with this. no problems. I like the clothing. I do singing battles mini games and more! Thank you Lunime! Editors note sometimes I have to re install the game. But when does that matter? Its perfect!
Great game sometimes it gets boring but I know some people love this game so much I recommend give it a try anyways if you dont like it Uninstall it but its At least give it a try cause its a good game

Gacha life is a nice relaxing game where u can make characters and they look amazing. (In my opinion). If you like designing for no cost then gacha life is the right game for you.
So like theres this glitch when I was playing gacha life when I came back to the studio there was like a glitch where all ur chacters are the same and like different style and there colors are blue and yellow and u cant touch them until u rejoin when u rejoin u get ur chacters back and pls make le...Full ReviewSo like theres this glitch when I was playing gacha life when I came back to the studio there was like a glitch where all ur chacters are the same and like different style and there colors are blue and yellow and u cant touch them until u rejoin when u rejoin u get ur chacters back and pls make levels reach higher the only level people can reach is level 1 and I love this game Im just putting my opion of what happened

I hate this update. i mean people have been making innopropriate content but still!! you couldve just removed the skin color on shirts and the red color ability to the fade thing when you make the oc cry. not remove clothes or anything that makes a good oc! overall the game is fine. they arent updating this anymore i believe since gacha club is out
I love this game even when you can make videos and dress up! But the gacha heat... Im a kid and I dont want to see it! Its yuck! But I recommend it you get the game!
I love this app it can make your own caracter and wear cut dresses and cut faces i love it and there is an upgrade fro this its calld gacha club and i love that to as long as they dont make bad videos about it like gacha heat i hated it little kids do it but still love this app
Nice game but I have a suggestion for a new color preset Hot Love cause it looks cool its hot pink and red it would be a great addition to the game ok buh bye
Okay so the only thing that I dont like is how they took some things that I really liked. I dont understand why they took away some of the things they did. BUT the verrrrrrry bad part is that they only changed the virson for only people not on iPhones. Its not fair at all. This needs to be changed...Full ReviewOkay so the only thing that I dont like is how they took some things that I really liked. I dont understand why they took away some of the things they did.

Its my opinion that pretty much any game where you can just make characters is relaxing. My daughter is obsessed with all the Gacha games.
This app is absolutely awesome! Only reason I rated one star is cause Id like to see more options for backgrounds poses and animals like more horses for example.
This game is Good but can you please make more clothes hair and others (more features) its a really fun game but when we played for an 2 hour or 1 hour its start lagging so can you fix that
This is an amazing game to play but when you try to change the avatar there are added but this games makes me happy and I am giving this game a 45 because of the adds but if there were no adds then I would give this game a 55 but when I play this game I would make a avatar just like me and I enjoy...Full ReviewThis is an amazing game to play but when you try to change the avatar there are added but this games makes me happy and I am giving this game a 45 because of the adds but if there were no adds then I would give this game a 55 but when I play this game I would make a avatar just like me and I enjoy this game

Its a great app and my sister loves making characters on here! Sometimes it can lag but other than that its great!
That what i wrote before WAS true! but now the game is bugging me with default characters!! nearly EVERY time i d enter another mode (mostly NPC chat mode but that was very coooll!) Update 2 Aug BUG was fixed and I am enorm happy with the app I mean I made an anime with this!
I love it just some of the designs and stuff need special accessories where we cant adjust! Thats my only problem.. I have both of the game Gacha Club and Gacha Life. I hope you take my opinion to mind.
This is a very very good game like gacha club I give this a five star but could like update the game it is getting boring using the same thing over and over again could you please do it?
great game moves so smoth the one down side is that i get this glitch where all my characters turn into this thing and it wont let me press anything and i have to refresh. its still an amazing game and you should play it.
I had a very good experience in gacha life. I has so much fun making my own characters! When I found out that gacha club was released I downloaded it straight away. It was a really lovely experience though. Im hoping to see rate my OC soon!
This is so cool! You can customize alot of characters with your own style! I love itbut....one thing...you can make inappropriate...things on there like gacha uwu cats or naked its not good I reccomend that please can you not make it inappropriate ...
Its a amazing game! I switched to gacha club because the amout of ads I was getting but I wanted to give it a try and its so far good!!
Gacha life is a very good game if you like roleplaying and dressing up this is the game for you the characters are cute and you could do use your imagination to decorate your own character if you like decorating characters you say get this game I read this game five and I give it a 5 rating
I dont like it it takes sooooo much longer to make a glmm than in gacha club bc in gacha life you have to go back and fourth from home and studio if you want to make a mini movie and you cant change the out line color so i dont reccomend using gacha life for a mini movie but for just makeing cha...Full ReviewI dont like it it takes sooooo much longer to make a glmm than in gacha club bc in gacha life you have to go back and fourth from home and studio if you want to make a mini movie and you cant change the out line color so i dont reccomend using gacha life for a mini movie but for just makeing characters this is still eh but its good ig
I think this game is great its just that when k first one had to download i had to delete 5 apps its the same thing with gacha club and I think you shouldnt have to delete lots of games before downloading the game put this is really cool.
I absolutely love this app! GL and GC make a good combo. The only thing that lacks the 1 star is that gachatubers overuse the jetblack option and its kinda weird. Overall 1010.
I love this game so much I also watch it on YouTube like Gacha stories there are so many options outfits props wallpaper etc but I would like there to be all the options which are in Gacha club
This amazing......and i like this games that face is so small and the cute me like the of cute and pretty..pls cant the wait gacha life in gacha club we well the real break us in the good gacha games..

Uhh well when I played this game in I think 2019 or 2020 I was playing this and then the random loading advertisement came up so it made me furious and I have to say this bu pls put back the old poses mouths and pls dont randomly put the loading advertisement. If you update it pls let me know.
This Game is Amazing! You can make Cute looking anime characters! And More! All though this game needs a little bit more clothes to pick from and hairs.... but overall this is a Good Game! 5 Stars D
its the best app ever but I have a cool idea... in the props you press on pets what if each pet had 5 or 6 poses! Just an idea but please do!
Great game! I love it alot hundreds of clothing options! Mini games! Objects! Gems! And so much more play and buy it if you havent already!
I love how you can dress up your character! Def reccomend to all the kids ranging from 812! These apps are super fun you can do many things as playing games! Super fun Highly reccomend!
This game is so much fun! I love how many options there are and all the mini games! So far so good there are no bugs and I am already over level 50!
I love this game ! Thank you 4 deleting other color because of gacha h3t keep ot up And pls fix the glitch weeks ago my characters was gone and all was charactery and my level was so high idk i cant move it and the bwckround was moving i hope it get fix!

This app is really fun! I like creating new characters with my sister. I will admit it gets kind of boring over time but I still come back and play it pretty often!
Its okay. I just need the bending down pose and the tounges back. I cant create Anything without that stuff. I tried and tried to find the gacha life 1 on this. (Im on mobile.) Please add this stuff back! Thats all I want..
I LOVE GACHA. But its having difficulties like when I put someone in an animated pose my gacha life doesnt work as well but the app is still to good to be true I love it to much!!!!
This game is pretty good! You can customize avatars make videos but I wish there was more games but after all its still fun and nice to play for. 5 stars
I LOVE THIS GAME you can create charecter and make your own stories get gems and earn prizes and learn more about the charecters in life I cant believe Ive been playing this for over a year

Its so cool! You can create whatever you imagine and in my opinon there osint much ads in the game only a few and you should install Gacha Club too!
Okay I really dont know if its my devices problem or the games problem but after I agree to the terms and stuff it just displays a white screen.... please rectify it.....I heard this game is nice...and I really want to play it...
i love this game Ive bin playing since i was 4 Im 8 now but one time or 2 it went on a add but instead of showing a add it changed all my characters name to character and made them all the same and 1 time when i was naming a character it wouldnt let me of it I had to reinstall the game.
This game was so Fun after it Came out but i would like you to add Some more clothes like Gacha club but The game has been Boring for a while i would like you to add online wolrd Were people play with other people like that . Bye!

So I played this game on a friends phone and loved it instantly. I just finished dowloading the app but im not kidding it took 2 hours it was insane. This might not be something you have control over but if you do then please try ti fix it. Thanks
Its a super amazing app! I would definitely recommend it!! You can make amazing characters and make skits! You can also make super cool pictures for like home or lock screens!
I miss the old game and fandom so much game is still amazing. But its still annoys me that you cant pick some colours but I know the reason so its fine.

I LOVE IT!! You should play this! Its fun! Plus you can design any character! Theres more slots in the top right corner of the screen! (Not at the top top right corner)
I give it 4 star. I love this game cause I can make a lot of mini movies but I have 1 problem. When I use the animated poses its so laggy! Please fix this.
Great game I love to play this when Im bored. Its fun to make characters especially with the bonus of not having to buy ANYTHING for an avatar. I love it.
Its a great game overall but its a bit laggy and the ads are a bit annoying but I have seen worse If you like simple character creating this is for you but I recommend gacha club more
The game is fun but the reason why I gave three stars is because I have keep uninstall and reinstall everytime I have to play it so I hope they fix it

I love playing Gacha life. It is such a fun and creative experience for all ages! You can create characters go explore get to know other characters and so much more!
i like this so much!You can make some gacha tiktoks or yt! U can dress up yeah i like it! But i hate those community and gcaha heats! I hate them but i like normal gacha! But i just want some new clothes or new hair hats accesories. Yeah! I hope there is some new things later!
This game is so amazing! It allows me to do what I love (which is creating outfits and characters) and just enjoy the cuteness and amazement from the characters
Its a fun game for kids at all ages and easy to work you can dress up characters however you want and have fun and the best part is that it doesnt need wifi so you can play it outside
Its an amazing game so much combinations Ive made almost 1000 different characters in the past few months no vids on it but its a good game so five stars thanks. Also I would add about 10 more stars because if lun and the other starters.
Hi! This game is great. it helped me create good and balanced social media platforms which gained me 2000 followers. Our community is ruined due to gacha heat but we all are working hard towards it and it get better each day
I read this game a 1010 theres lots of games trying to copy your company but I just think this game is cool its because theres lots of tiktok people playing this game but.... Theres lots of gacha heat can you fix that
great game but please add more hats and stuff like a pregnant shirt or the ability to make ur charecters pregnant. would reccomend if you are bored out of your mind and you need entertainment.

I love this game!! But I want a new update! More clothes! More hair! And the paint and mouths back! Dont forget the colors too! If they put gacha heat delete their account not that hard
Its SO fun but one issue is that its takes so long to download I do not know what happend last time I downloaded it at least we can play it and in roblox gacha life there is less clothes than normal gacha life I will give it a five just for the game.
Good game but tthey shiuld add more clothes and better purses along with the fact that theres this fluffy EXTREMELY Short crop top that they changed and put a shirt under but overall a very good and amusing game! However bc of these... inconveniences 4 stars Hope this reveiw helpss

I like it. It is fun because you can create different Gacha life people. You cant chat to others. You can make a mine move which an add to get gems.
its very good it has way more customization than gacha studiopocket chibi and i love the life feature so much! i love talking to npcs.
I love this app really its just ever since the update because of gacha heat every time I join now it logs me out right when I get on and I wanna delete it and redownload it but I dont wanna loose my characters so if this is a problem with anybody else please fix it overall great app!
Honestly if I could I would give game a rating of 10 out of 5 starts! I love it so much so many cool options to create your own awesome characters. For those people that like scaryish characters or those who love cute characters gacha lifes got you 3
Its a very nice game! But theres few problems though theres some points that it lags and reconnecting its pretty annoying
Well this is awesome but... I want the old one but I like the new but i love the old one And I Can make characters!! And Btw Charlotte said she will give me 999 999 gems when i finished the quiz i qill get it from Lucas her brother But I cant find Lucas in the Life? Can you fix it?
I absolutely love this game. My dad always asks why I play it I say I want to become a designer when I grow up and this game has a ton of outfits and my dad still doesnt understand why I play it when I told him like A MILLION TIMES but I love the game. (thank you for reading this )
This Game Is Fine. Its Okay This Is A Pretty Decent Game. But What Bugs Me Is All About The Adds Popping Up At The Bottom Of The Screen They Always Pop Up At Bad Timing.
i love this app i just wish i could get it better on games lol its the best i just think they should make options for music and colors for mouths and i think they should add a better cry look and more acsessorys and maby just maby atleast 2 more areas for the acsessorys and maby abit more like gacha...Full Reviewi love this app i just wish i could get it better on games lol its the best i just think they should make options for music and colors for mouths and i think they should add a better cry look and more acsessorys and maby just maby atleast 2 more areas for the acsessorys and maby abit more like gacha club why well gacha club is also kinda like gacha life but i like gacha life better but if it was more like gacha club it would be AMAZING!!!!!!!!! tysm for reading
Gatcha life is fun you can design your own characters and make your own sanarios in the studio and you earn gems by playing games (this is starting to look like a ad) I dont know I like it.
Love it but the thing is when you say some thing like class it becomes cla and its very annoying. Class is not a swear word. But I still love this app.
Pretty good it does glitch but otherwise i highly recomend it i think it is much better then gacha club (not including the limited supply)

Ive been downloading gacha life for 2 years now its awesome amazing and perfect but I want the old faces and the blush and the other 1.0.9 version plus 1.1.4 updates and thanks.
This game is awesome You can make your own little characters and you can make them to anything. But pls update with more clothes hair and backgrounds then it bill be the best thing Ive ever downloaded!!!
This is a very fun game I just wish that they had more stuff I love gotcha club its just as a problem I cant really control it
Because it allows us to make our own character and its easy to reset everything if you dont like the way you position it and you can do that 1000 and 1000 of time!
Great app but I have a problem gacha club is 10 while gacha life is 3 even though gacha club is more safer since you cant make heat in the app but you can make heat in gacha club and I think the age limit should be the opposite
Rly good app! I love how u can design and make stories with it! Ive gotten really creative with this game and I love it tysm for making this! And guys luni didnt create heat search in yt why luni didnt create heat if u think he made it
I love this game its so fun to make all deffrent characters but Im giving it 4 stars becuase when u play for a while its kinda hard to make unique charecters becuase u use all the stuff in the game so it dose need more stuff skirts pants shirts etc.
Well..I love this game I can make videos in yt but there are some glitches..when i put mouth like this but it used to come dark black and shapless but its a good game for all the ages and its safe of kids also!

Since this was a dressing character game. I dont recommend it for the guys since this is for girls and it is pointless to download. I do not think it improves their fashion skills since it only has very few clothings. Most of the outfits wouldnt match and it didnt help me when i was 9. I suggest that they stop playing this game this game until their 912. If you want to be an embarassment play this until your 21

Thanks this is long sorry

So fun! My sister loved it and always makes such funny characters! But Ive always tried to stop gacha heat and maybe you could add a update that allows to report people (such as gacha heaters) thats all I wanted to say.. ()!
This app is incredable! I love how you can create you own cute characters and make a story out of them. I love the variaty of clothing they have and is a fun way of creating an oc and drawing them. Over all this app is amazing.
Awsome game 1 problemso i was tring to make a beach scene and when i put the color to ALMOST match my characters skin tone when i went i to studio HIS SHIRT TURNED BLUE like i not gonna do nothing bad just wanna make a beach scene and when i did it on my dark skinned character it had no problem
Excellent. But if I have to rate this.. Ill rate it a four. Why? Because sometimes when I exit the app and then come back in my character resets. But it doesnt happen all the time. So can you fix that bug please? Thanks.
I use this game when Im at school in the car on the bus or even when Im at the house but whennindo is it i dont have some poses i really need or there is alot of ads and some faces o dokt have ( BUT expect all of that its a good game to play

In terms of organization its a mess. The color palettes are limited its nearly impossible to find the exact color I want. I see double items while browsing accessories and backgrounds are out of order. Some items have multiple slots for each varient which severely clutters the list(ex eyebrows can be on either or both eyes meaning each eyebrow type takes 3 slots for each varient) and could be fixed with more customizing options. The list goes on...
This is just amazing game all of the clothes and all of the like eyes and things theyre so cool this is so but this is my first time playing it but its really fun
Gacha club is better in other peoples opinions but I still have this one and all my friends and my sister keep telling me to download gacha club but I like gacha life because its a lot more simple nad less complicated
I really like this game! My channel runs by this game! BUT the gacha life heads are too small compared to the gacha club heads (ik you can change headsize in gacha club)
This game is very fun.And it has mini game that you can play and do movies. And make your character anything you want this game is really fun game 55 for me
I love this app. Theres so many options to design ur own ocs! Im currently starting my own yt acc. Its going well so far honestly. Sadly some kids use this app wrongly for gacha heat. But I try to avoid that!

My problem is..when i make my skin in normal skin color i cant open cloth i mean its like i can use color liie the body so thatthe problem. I like this game i can make my skin in gacha club to! Just that.. Writting byKeyDream
Nice Game but one problem on Android all the things change you dont have to change it! But its just a little uhmp so like I want to use another mouth but its different its just annoying that the things change like the dress in the shirts their is holes in the hips
At first it can play smoothly..after 3 or 4 days when i try to.play it always back to main menu..it irritates mei unstall an reinstall again but still same issue..ples hope you fix my problem..next.time.i.will give 5 star if you fix my problem..
This Is The Greatest App ever but when I downloaded it I had to wait 1 min until it loads but still this is the greatest app ever like gacha club and I hope there will be more bug fixes to the app! D
this is good but when I open it...it closes tho...... but also the brave ones who use gacha life..pls becareful for all the glitches...and lunime warned everyuser of gacha life that they have nothing to do with scary things happening...thank you for reading this
Ive had this game for so long and nothing has ever been wrong with it besides my phone being laggy! All the 1 stars for this game just have a laggy device I promise!! Anyways it would be nice if gacha club had probs like this game
THIS GAME IS SO AWESOME ITS ALSO NOT BORING YOU CAN ALSO DRESS UP OR CREATE A MOVIE OR STORY THE THING THAT I DONT LIKE IS THE ADD ITS VERY ANNOYING ESPECIALLY WHEN UR ABOUT TO MAKE A DRESS BUT SO FAR I LIKE IT ONLY THE ADSS I RECOMMEND TO DOWNLOAD THIS GAME ITS COOL
Awesome! Has so many options and colors to scoose! I wish it would let you go shirtless so no shirt shows under hoodies and stuff tho.
I really loved this app!! I downloaded it since 2018 and ever since I downloaded it I played with it nonstop BUT I have a few suggestions can you please add more optionoutfit like those? Thank you
I love it and the game but the new poses are a bit weir d (no offence) and maybe you could replace the skilt with another game but over all I love it and luni made and excellent job in making this game! 3
Its really good!! But when Im making storys its kinda laggy like when you put the character on different place like you gonna tap them... Its lagging But I prefer you guys to Download this Game!! You wont regret it!!

I love this game it inspires other people to become a gacha tuber but the reason why Im giving it 4 stars is because people are still makeing heat by using gacha life and Gacha Club so we have to stop gacha heat but other than that its the best game I have ever played in my entire life!
I want to give you this three stars because theres a glitch on here Ive seen some of the videos on YouTube and and also doesnt look extremely realistic but I really like the game
Best game ever!

Good game but theres one problem the gacha ( place where you use gems ) never works for me it turns white. Anyway good game.
I like it! Its so unique you can make and character you want but when you delete it and come back its only a black screen and It doesnt do anything else so can you fix that please
I loved this game so much until when I logged on my characters went back how they used to look when everyone just started playing now I have to recreate the characters (
I love the game and I love making videos with it But theres a problem with android you cant find all the cloths in the game and the drooling mouths dont have drool on it but in apple all of it is there so can you fix it? But I still love the app and thats why I gave 5 stars
This is a really fun game and I havent seen any glitches in it so far its rlly good the way you can make loads of characters but I dont like the way you can only have a few on studio other than that its one of the best games ever

I like this gamecause it doesnt reset the uh ah!yes the characters so I love this sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much!! Yay I love this so much!!but bad news is that theres scary stuffs truely... Im not sure what is the scary stuffs..but I heard it
Gacha is the best game i ever played it can show the way we fell it can actualy be a type of art and you can make litle stories and movies. Gacha community is the reason why i every morning when i woke up fell happier bc i thoot of gacha.
I like the models that me and my friend made but there is some creepy gliches and its not for a 3 year old will play its to creepy they might have nighrmares so I hope that you can fix it.
Its very good! But I give 2 star because I want back the old things (blush and things like this) Please if you can give back the old gacha I will be so happy
I love this game so much! The reason why I love it is because all the textures the reason the textures are so good because the person actually took time and effort to make these and this turned out really good!
I just love this game I started youtube its going smooth this app is just amazing there is soo much to do soo many choices just soo cool but sometimes it closes by its own and sometimes my character like re sets I mean when I add Few things there just re sets overall its app is the best awesome job

I love this sm! you can customize and make your own character but the thing is why cant i get the old ver?i tried but it didnt work .
Ngl this is a very fun game and you can dress the characters up in a lot of different ways. And ther isnt an add every 5 sec. So 1010 would recomend.
Its cute and I like to custmise but I hate that there are so many ads.... Nya life mode is good but I hate the thing that my gacha club has shadow luni saying the gacha must end... Pwease luni dont end gacha
The game is actually very fun! You can dress up your character play mini games and make stories with studio mode! Although there are bugs....But Im fine with it!
This is a great game u can create ur own character even with skintones clothes mouth eyes eye brows sleeves shoesboots blush and prop ofc pose too but the thing that i rated this 4 star is there are adds so pls get rid off them lunime Ty.
This game is fun but the adds is not to lot i like it and it also give me frees gems to collect! But i dont know how to do the game i just do the cracther only...SOOO FUNN!
I love this game because you can make a tiny people and giant people plus you can make whatever you want and do all kind of things cant play the game if you do bad word in the chat best game ever if I could rate 10 Stars I would
not a lot is cool in this app i suggest gacha club cause you have more features and you can change adgustments and more than 6 characters can be made and more back up characters but what can i say beginings are always new and old
This app is great But it tags out words like pass and other words with a curse word in it. I understand how it happens but Still please fix it.
Its obviously great! U can customizer characters And decorate them! But theres one problem..Its not very big but annoying adds pop up when I make characters please fix it please it really annoys me but I love ur game then Ill give it a five star bye!
Amazing game! You can dress up the characters how ever you want. But one thing I hate about gacha is gacha heat.. It makes the gacha community worse. ( I know you didnt make up the Gacha Heat things luni. P.S Savethegachacommunity )
I really really like this game. Everything is awesome the graphics the hairs the clothes the poses.

I like my Oc in gacha life. When I started I feel like Im going much better now of creating a character in gacha life. But this is my problem when there is a internet Im getting lag.
Amazing game I love it I cant stop playing it you can costumise your own characters and you can make stories also there are different backgrounds (places).

I love this game sadly it is not as good as the newer game gacha club but here is a sugestion bring back some of the old things that are now in gacha club and it might get more downloads!
I played this game since 2017 and it was fun.. no lag and no glitch.. I tried gacha club and its also good but its hard to memorize the options and adjustments quickly so I sticked with gacha life.. where im used to
Its a good game its not laggy no ads unless u buy dinoands for free and easy to make charters but gacha club was hard and was very laggy but still both of them are a good game
This app is overall great I love to make gacha mini movies! But the only thing is it has a really laggy screen most of the time whenever I want to either click on a item or a button itll be very laggy so please fix this problem! Ill be pleasured.
This is the best even though the mouths look kinda weird and I still like this but thank you for deleting the inappropriate stuff I appreciate it. Now my 7 year old grandchild can play this!! Well.. I recommend gacha club
This is the coolest game ever so fun you make your own characters but but theres one more thing that you can never forget that you could save up all your coins just to get presents
I love this app so much! I enjoyed creating things but i dont like the fact that your able to make naked things. I could see all of this sort of stuff on youtube. Could you update the game and getvrid of thenskin colourd stuff? Thanks!
I love this game! so fun you can do anything you want whether youre in life mode talking to characters or customizing your character youll have fun while you do so.
I love this game i gave it 5 stars because i like it so much i enjoyed making characters and Giving them a prop if i want. Oh and i have a few problems theres to many ads but download it now its free in google app and play store what are you waiting for download gacha life now!
I love the game but today I was with my 4 year old cousin then she had went to gacha life.And the when we had opened it it had shown like lot of stuff so then I tried to help fix the error but I couldnt so I got scared a went off the game...
It was going perfectly but one day I tried to get on gacha life but it went right to a white screen. I keep trying to redownload it but it wont let me (
Love it! The gacha comunity is basicly most of what I watch and this is a great app to use when I get sick of all the glitching gacha club.
This game is awesome!! I rate this 4 stars because OF Gacha heat..But..i know it isnt Lunis (The creator) Fault..Because the kids are making those heat things..and its terribly disgusting.. But this game is really fun to play! But sometimes it lags PLEASE fix that! D

I downloaded it to see if it was as bad as i heard But no its pretty good except for two things the sound quality gets sound bit crunched some times idk how but it does and the frames drop a lot. but other than that its good

Its game is huge fun but on thing I dont like the fact that when l press hide and look to take a screenshot it just removes from hiding. ( I dont like that
This game is fun creative and really just a place where people get to use their imagination. I really like this game because you can create your own characters stories! I really recommend this game.
I love Gacha Life! The community grows day by day and I love the color options for a character! Lunime would you please add more space for character slots! Thank you for reading this review Recommend this app 1010!
So I was playing gacha life and I love this game so much it was a good game to but why did you get rid of the old version it was fun but please tell me when youll ad the other one
Great app! The only Downside to this app is that gacha club has very many options but gacha life does not I wish gacha life did because I find gacha club overwhelming with all the different buttons! Otherwise great app.
Love the customization freedom it gives you. Its a great way to make stories and make your own avatars. The clothing is adorable and I recommend it for everyone.
Great game! There is a wide variety of outfits to choose from and lots of gifts to unbox so you can get many new items! Makes edits movie and so much more. I recommend.
This is a very good game I love creating the characters but its all threads that pop up and just a quick reminder to save the gacha community
I would have given it 5 stars but I gave 4 because of the update and I always felt update were meant to make games better but the gacha life update made the experience really really really tiny bit worse

This game is awesome but before 5 star now 4 because there too much ads and also I already make new character but it doesnt saved always and also now when loading advertisement I just quickly get on the studio but now it just pop up too this is very bad thing
I like gacha life its just the dummys can you make it like where you can actually talk to them like tap on the screen and put what you want to say. That would be great if you did that and thx!

I love this app!! I love how I can make many characters and actually play with them! Although the game tends to lag a bit and the worst part there are gacha heat makers(
I really like the app but if there were more options to customize the gacha it would be nice and Ive experienced an issue where I would customize a gacha than come off the app go back than it would be gone so yeah no other issues besides those
I think is so slow.... i think is a scam alot people thinks great but this is the greatest app from us also we have a new app as gacha club and also gacha life is very great and is made from 2019 also my mom told it waste a 1dollars on our money package also is very good i will give 5 stars great!
Great game it doesnt even need internet I can all kinds of roleplays even play some games I can come up. With my own Imagination and creations the only thing is I cant pick my own color not all the colors are there
This game is amazing! I love it sooo much! But next time please try and make an anime movie maker game because Ive always wanted to make my own anime movie! Anyway I love your games!
i really love this app it is so creative and fun! but there should be added justtt a little more items even though there is a lot theres other rhings that would look great on the characters other than that i love this app and it is very fun to play ( )
Super fun mini games and so many characters and creativity I usually use other apps to make my OCs but over all very fun I recommend downloading gacha life If your a kid who doesnt like barbies this is definitely the game to play!
Its is a very good game! One thing though I cant always get in. If there is something wrong with the game please respond. Other than that 100 recommend!
I like the game because it can help me to design stuff but it recently bought in my mind that we have to save the gacha community because there are so many people doing inappropriate stuff but at least you guys are concerned about it and yeh its pretty cool ngl
I like this game but there are some weird glitches that scared me I played it at 3am and the game change my character and I found pictures on my phone that I did not take.........so believe me or not it is true
It kinda hurt me the fact that the only options for genders were boy and girl. I did a comparison of gatcha life and gatcha club. Gatcha club is 11 037x better than gatcha life because you have so many more options and you dont need to pick a gender!

Its good! But I cant comment on Gacha Club cause something happened and I was wondering if you could put a Kalimba instrument on Gacha Club. Probably not cause we had a chance to add.
I love so much but I know the romurs are fake about the gacha glitches but I got the weirdest glitch my characters was replaced with a character then I reset the game and it was normal please fix that glitch I almost got a jumpscare too i got it two times!
This game is amazing there are fun things to do like making charectars playing mini games making new friends and MUCH more!Its keeps me entertainted for hours!I recommend you guys to play this game.
This is really good you can make a character and make more and you can even make it yourself and theres stuff there you can also do like play games and get to know other characters
I used to play this game but not anymore cause I already have Gacha Club. Anyways its a really cute game but not many thing We can do to customize it but its a great game.
Its a nice game you could add more things in it and when I waste 5 gems for a new item I cant get it I dont now where it is so please fix my problem
I think it could use a little bit more detail in the dress up area like gacha club. But overall I love it
I loved the app and I am a gacha tuber but then some glitch happened and Everytime I try to go into the app it kicks me out. I need an explanation of whats happening and at the time I am writing this.... t still cant get into the app.
I just play this at 1000 and it glitched with rainbow hair and alot of her skin and i just restarted it it happen again please fix this glitched because i want to play gacha life at 1000 and i will rate this 45
I love this game but the problem is that it has a BIG amount of mb i like this to be at least 2049 mb so that way I could give it a 5star
Amazing game Ive been playing this since I was six now Im ten I do have a suggestion for u can u make more slots like in gacha club were u put the characters you done with if y want. Game without slot of adds get this game

This game was so awesome But when my wifi is turned on. The adds always popped out of nowhere.but it was good you can create ypour own characters especiually a lot of hair and clothes.Thats all.

You can customize charcters and change them into anything you want! Many outfits to choose from! Its a really great app and I do reccomend to get it! (if you want) Theres a few bugs but the bugs arent bad so it is still fun to play with! You can do many things on this app you could even make videos and skit on this! It has any style anyone can think of! Many colors hairs clothes
Amazing but add more to it. And please enable the option where you tap body then tap the 3 dots and then you keep changing head size until you can make the eyes small amd the mouth big!
Its good I love the way you can make your own character but this thing called gacha heat is taking over it I think you should rethink the age... Thats why I gave it a 4!
Even though I use gacha club now I still pretty much use gacha life and its a nice game mini games and Life just overall great game although I think Luni should start taking care of this game last updated was last year. shirts hairstyles
I love this app bcs you can design your own outfit and cute but sometimes when you make a character and leave the game it doesnt save the character(
Amazing i play it all the time and it keeps me busy and theres loads of characters to make into ur style but the one thing is that i cant get the bigger blush and certain poses i see on tiktok so i would like if i could do that but when i accidentally uninstalled it when it gets to 100 it restarts
This game is absolutely amazing! And the best part is you get 20 000 gems for free! You can customize your own characters and explore Gacha life in life!
I love this game and the dressup options are so fun but the ads have increased ALOT. I know that gacha club came out and u need money but reduce the ads please. Other than that this game is the best.
This is like the 7th time id have to uninstall this game because it was not working properly but ive allways loved this game so its totally worth it.
I love this game but I wish that they didnt update it bc now it is harder to make videos I like the old version more another thing that I have a problem with is that gacha club has the old stuff but gacha life doesnt?
I think its pretty good for three reasons 1 not much ads 2 they give you lots of choices and 3 I feel deeply connected to the characters already
Great app! You can do a lot on it there is some adds but the app works offline so you can turn off adds for free If you turn off your internet.
I like this game so much But there is only one thing so when i make a character i change the eyebrow and then it change itself when Im not looking no joke but is it a bug or a glitch? but still I like this game so much i rate this 5 star...
This game Is fun and awesome you can create lots of cute anime characters but an ad pop up and when i exit the ad all my characters were all the same and they were saying something and theyre name was character that happend to me all the time! Its a glitch maybe
This game is amazing especially for people who want to create characters and OCs and stories. But gacha heat has also been going on and having more people doing it causes more chance of the game being deleted.
This game is great!But when it alerts you it sometimes takes long to view the add.Other than that is excellent!I reccomend it
This game is amazing! There are so many different things to do and the details ohh the details are so cool the different positions you can do too! I give this game 5 stars!
I love this game. But there is 1 problem. Everytime i play this game. On few weeks later i open the gacha life but its not working its like ALL WHITE i press everywhere but it cant so pls fix the problem ill give you 5 star!
Honistly rlly great. I only wish that there was an option for other genders and that it wasnt stereo typing so much. Also that there would be a online feature where you can play multilayer in a gacha world
Its a great game but please Fix the amount of ads I would of gave it five stars. please fix that issue overall its a wonderful game
This is honestly a great game for young children it can be used for any ages and I love how it can also work offline I usually play this alot since my internet is not that good but I do recommend getting this game and I hate how people use this app wrong x
Like the characters and how you get to customize them I wish you had more customisation because like theres not that much to choose from thats all I like the game go its a really good game

Its a cool game I love making movies and dressing up characters also Love to play the mini games in gacha just saying maybe you should make a few updates ...like the colors when you are making your character.
This is a pretty good game! I love getting to make people! One thing it just doesnt have much character slots. I like that there are a lot of options for hair clothing and more!

I love this game but the reason a gave it four stars is when I play gacha life it kicks me out sometimes and deletes the character I make also gacha club does that to me sometimes

I keep refreshing it and cleaning the cache and its still glitched and the way is I reset the gacha . But please fix ( I dont want my ocs to be lost I made hardwork for all of them.
The app works now! 4 Stars because I like gacha club more and in my opinion its harder to make characters on gacha life after you are used to gacha club. Good app overall.
