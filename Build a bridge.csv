Build a Bridge
Seems like a great game. One of the worst for me though. Bugged out on the third level when showing me a particular move to do and I cannot for the life of me get past this. Doesnt matter what I touch on the screen or where. It wont register that Im copying exactly what is being shown.

It is really o stars . There is a impossible bit and the only way to win is to pay. Dont even bother getting it because it is also very laggy.
Cute idea  but the controls are so ghastly that they make the game unplayable. Im sure that once one masters the game  the controls are at least tolerable  but that isnt the point. Learning the game should not be excruciating. Uninstalled.
This game is great and all... but lets be honest this game needs a sandbox mode. IDC how its implemented though  as long as its added.
It has said more games coming soon for a very very long time nowbut no more levels get added other then the fact that there are not many levels it is a good game

i like it Its a nice game but i rlly want a sadbox and that would make my 3 stars go up to 5 and if there is a sandbox that I could even make my own land scape on it would be a ten star
Hotels  couldnt even get past the training level  the item wouldnt stretch fast enough. Life is too short  uninstalled
From some point you will have to watch ads to unlock a level  and if there is something wrong with the internet (unable to load ads) you will not be able to continue the game.
The game is crashing. It already crashed 78 times the game took so long time to load the game is too laggy. I thought this will be a good game but it disappointed me.
Pretty fun game I would recommend it. Ads wont blow up in your face every 5 Minutes. Kudos to the game Devs for that.
Pretty decent. Great graphics. Bonus challenges are a nice touch
Perfect game  but I had one problem. I bought it from my mobile and the purchase never happened in my tablet.
Wow this game is fun. I like that you have to be creative. Dont underestimate the power of the triangle!!!
Funny game  you can be creative  but notification in the middle of the night  for two nights in s row  made me give up. I dont like to wake to STUPID NOTIFICATIONS FEOM GAMES. And there is no place to disable them.
Havent been playing long. But so far no complaints. Ads can be a bit much at times but it is what it is.
I love this game! Its so challenging and stressrelieving!
Too much ads fix it with less ads cause when you dont have internet it wont work
It is a fun game no adds and the hints are cheap.
preety good but i downloaded it in my pc and it kinda just freezes on the first level . I love it but i hate this glitch
Its a fun construction game that has barely any ads and alot of levels
Basically poly bridge on mobile  I love it.
Somewhat weird controls  wish it was more accurate to dragging if that makes sense
Google play games required ? Too bad. Uninstalled. It was fun before it tried to force me to install it  but now Im not ready anymore to play a game which needs to work with thieves.
Got to a certain level and cant proceed without watching ads or buying passes
This game is 2010 Stars its just that there wasnt enough star icons but I couldnt vote for I only got five stars because they wanted 2010 Stars
Game wont even start. Keeps loading and nothing new
Good but once you get to high levls it is so hard you have to use a hint but that might be because i am bad to but i have ben playing this game for a long time.
Only 30 levels free  them you have to buy new world. And its filled with tons of ads.
1. There is not a sandbox mode 2. Why have us pay for the extra maps when we could have to unlock them
Fun but sometimes anoying when cant get throught level.
Very nice game but this game graphics boring 3 stars
Super fun bridge building game it is a nice sandbox game 10 out of 10 recommend. 
Its soo fun playing this game and never improve this let it be like this and make mapes free
This game is just a laggy rip off of bridge constructor.
Ive seen many YouTubers play this game and now I finally found it and I really love it you should get it ALL
Its a good game for making the brain sharp and sometimes timepass
grate game very low ads just how i like it (I dont like ads pls remove them)
I had this game on my tablet  now I have a phone  it was hard on tablet but I hope I can do better now that Im older
I like building Bridges and skyscrapers  so this game is REALLY REALLY FUN!
Bad attempt of a game. Very bad building and so laggy.
Its good and its a different type of game and from it we can learn how to make breege I love it
i cant even pass the tutorial becouse there is no stop button

Really had a good time playing this game. It is really interesting how different levels have been built. We can get 3 starts on every level if we try. Really good game and challenging.
Adverts are got damn annoying  its just too many too often.
Every game I seem to play has ridiculous amounts of ads and Im sick of it  I know the developer s need revenue but come on having to watch an ad to unlock a level is just stupid deleted it as soon as it asked me to watch and will do the same for every game I play going forward
This is the most fun Ive ever had this game is ligit awesome. Its good for stress releaf
Such ads  every lvl
Its a good game but the reason I gave it 3 stars cuz its not that fun and the level is not the same as the computer one usually people write a lot but Im to lazzy to write a lot and it is not that addictive for me
This bridge game is so much fun! The art is also amazing! It will test your mind on physics with a puzzle twist!
Its a fun game  but getting bored with the same builds! There needs to be a new level 2 stage!!!
Real neat game until the 3rd level when it will not quit showing the demonstration finger and actually allow me to complete the action. Really couldnt even be bug free through 3 levels? Bummer. Game seems like it would be cool.
This game is a rip off of the game called Poly Bridge on steam and is hardly playable. If you like this the idea of this game but want better levels and no ads  just buy Polybridge for 10 instead of wasting your time on this poorly made copy of Poly Bridge
Nice game  but too many ads. Every i finish a stage  the ads its coming out. Very disturbing 
This is a very fun game.I like it a lot I recommend this if you dont know what to play.I also spend hours playing although the levels are kinda hard it is fun

Looks like a good game. However it is hard to place the roads and other materials and also is a COMPLETE carbon copy of poly bridge

Dont like the game it gets very hard after 7 or 8 levels and the harder you try the more boring it is I dont recommend this game to anyone. Actually i didnt want to give it 1 star i wanted to give it half a star.
It is a very bad game I understand why people dont like this game that much.well u guys make a point so its actually bad at level 6 cus I cant get past through it!thats why no one should download this game its frustrating like really really frustrating and I make a point right guys???
What happened to level 3 ?! Its stuck
This is best game ever you can learn many things from this game
the levels are just too hard and when you pay in game cash to get hints and press build it for me it makes things you cant make or do!
Ads. Starting from lvl. 3 almost every time you try to test the bridge  there is a video ad which cannot be stopped or avoided. Unplayable. Just awful. DO NOT INSTALL!!! AVOID!!!
The game only have few levels are free. The graphics is not that good  easy to use and the tutorial is good.
Fun to play and challenging
The amount of ads makes this game unplayable. After the tutorial  there is a 30 second ad after each attempt. It was fun for 5 minutes. Now its uninstalled. The privacy policy is extremely invasive!
Pretty nice game but there is a problem with the graphics I think you should upgrade the graphics and make the game more realstick
Nice  I thought it would be a easy game poorly made for kids but I was wrong it got more and more difficult each level. I really like the physics as well. I recommend this game for people who want a challenge.
not only are the controls god annoying  theres a few bridges where you have to do ridiculous designs due to not having base points ands honestly the physics is the most ridiculous part. how can you make a physics bases game with bad physics. if you want a bridge game save up 84p and buy poly bridge...Full Reviewnot only are the controls god annoying  theres a few bridges where you have to do ridiculous designs due to not having base points ands honestly the physics is the most ridiculous part. how can you make a physics bases game with bad physics. if you want a bridge game save up 84p and buy poly bridge  dont waste your time with this.Google Play Most Innovative Game 2017  Winner     
Bob the builder broke the games heart  Told me it needs fixing  he Said its filled with ads and it lags  lot of parts were missing.
I love this game its amazing but the ship lvl is impossible and I like the game thats why I give it a five star
Fun and engaging  may well pay to remove ads. Removed one star as many of the cool interactive bits which made me love the first world are sadly missing from the other worlds  developers any plans to add some cool ones in?
its nice but the smoothness not good
The ads kinda ruin it. Its kind of fun but it gets pretty tedious after the first couple levels  especially with ads every time you fail a level or start a new one.
Good game  fair amount of ads. You can pay to remove.
Fun offline game puts your mind to work and is educational. The graphics amazing no ads with wifi off nice calm game.

Great game  but I would like it if you added a sandbox mode so we wouldnt have to worry about our budget when were building a bridge. It would also be nice if you added more to the mechanics of the game so that you would be able to make your bridge open up for example  other than that  great game.
Great game! Fun and challenging. Unfortunately  there are very few levels and it seems like they have no intention of adding more. Dispite the more coming soon sign at the end of the existing levels. There has been no new level in years.

The controls are awful when you drag a line it doesnt track with your finger. You have to draw it then adjust it up or down every single line. Also doesnt work with a stylus on note 10 just irritating all around to play im sure its fun but I just cant get past the bad controls
Not much creativity in this game. I would recommend making it a lot easier. If you dont build it the way the devs want  it most likely will fail. And just way to many ads  they pop up every time you win a level or fail a level. But overall 25
Overall a great game. A few problems however. Like many others  you have too many ads and when closing the app I lose progress on the last 10 levels completed along with challenges. A great game and is quite enjoyable but needs work like anything else

This game is fun and cool and all but the levels can be too difficult  some arent even possible without help  and they give you too little money to work with. And you dont make bridges  some of the levels you need to make ramps?
I really like this game but there is just one problem I am having and it is that the levels get super hard fast it went from easy to really hard in a short time  I would be happier if you guys can make the levels less harder when we just started.

Excellent bridge game!! Reminds me of some other good bridge games too i also like the fact that you can complete a bridge to unlock extra missions for that same mission which gives the game far more challenge too. Few adverts  a challenge for the brain great game 
To say the least  its a good game but in terms of the controls  Id rather eat a turd through my toenail.
really good game not sure if they were inspired by poly brigde very similure games almost look identicle but all together great game i recommend it.

Terrible game its centered around you having to watch videos to pass the levels.
Even more fun than expected. Physics games dont often have as much creative freedom as this does  Ive been able to make bridges shaped like functioning wheels  swings  and seesaws. Its honestly a lot of fun.
The amount of ads within this game is ridiculous  and completely spoils the fun in it  everything you do you have to endure watching 30sec ads  honestly I wouldnt bother downloading until its reduced the ads
A game first a fiendish test of hypothetical situations where a crossing is needed... second. Taxidermy is intriguing bridge building just fun frustrating and challenging before you drink your tea and biscuits...
Way overloaded with ads. I get that ads are part of a free version but this game will pop up 30s video ads with the tiniest of X buttons to exit after 5s  and they will come after beating a level  losing a level  selecting a level  etc etc.. just way too often.

Fantastic game and it is addictive also but we want more levels in it
Absolutely one of the most IRRITATING apps ever. Not because of the game  but because the app is poorly made  ads every single level  glitchy  just a bad time all around. 1 star  0 if I could.
Couldnt do anything on level 3  so gave up. Buggy  or just not intuitive.
Why is everyone complaining about ads and how it doesnt work??? Its a GREAT GAME! Ive been playing it for like an hour straight and i had like 3 ads. I dont know about you but this works and theirs barley any ads.
Really hard game  not for weak minded individuals. Only install if you have a doctorate in engineer or your brain will melt into a puddle of asphalt  suspension cables and wooden beams
the controls are terrible! why is it so hard to make it go straight across. you always have to go up and work it around just to make it go straight. i played games like this on the computer and loved it so im really disappointed.
Good game overall but there is just TOO many ads. Thats why I deleted it
Ads are abusive  after every bridge attempt  otherwise would be enjoyable.
Its pretty good but for me it took forever to download the game it took about 3 days for me to get the game cuz I really want to test the game out because somebody claimed it was the best game ever
Dude first of all every level has to be in a specific shape to win and it always goes over budget on the higher levels second of all THE ADS FOR HINTS each time u use a hint it goes up by 100 so if I want a 3rd hint WHICH I ALWAYS NEED I HAVE TO WATCH 3 30 SECOND ADS AND 3RD BUT NOT THE LEAST THIS I...Full ReviewDude first of all every level has to be in a specific shape to win and it always goes over budget on the higher levels second of all THE ADS FOR HINTS each time u use a hint it goes up by 100 so if I want a 3rd hint WHICH I ALWAYS NEED I HAVE TO WATCH 3 30 SECOND ADS AND 3RD BUT NOT THE LEAST THIS IS A RIPOFF OF POLY BRIDGEGoogle Play Most Innovative Game 2017  Winner        
Love this game! Simple yet beautifully designed. Completed all 3 worlds  then went through a second time to get all 3 stars! Hoping for more levels in the future.
Its an ok game but very basic and theres literally an ad (sometimes 30 seconds and unskippable) after every level or every failure of a level. Its more than annoying and frankly gross on the devs part.
The overall gameplay is great  but the amount of ads you have to see is gigantic. And my phone kept overheating from this game whenever I tried to play it even if I let it sit for an hour.
Too frequent with the ads. And the ads are 30 seconds each. No thanks. Game is okay so far  didnt get far enough as I couldnt tolerate the ads.
Ads  ads  ads.. another force you to spend to get rid of ads. Could be such a fun game if not for ads every time you pass or fail a build a bridge.
If you listen closely there are kids talking which is disturbing I listened closely and the kid said mom I want to go home or I want to go home I would not recommend it and I think it should be tooken down if you have the game I would listen closely to the noises
Im good at this game its not bad at all its good there is no ads by the way its a awesome game all you gotta do is build a perfect bridge. And you can pass not others say bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla .
I like the game but there are some slight mistakes like level 15...I cant pass it and so couldnt the hint option  I used all 3 hints yet it still fails to pass the level...please fix that
Commercials  commercials  commercials after every round! I not only will not buy your application  but also uninstall it
Its pretty fun to play  not to many ads just an overal decent game
Its so cool and I like it so I well rate it a 55! 
Warning Ad may contain a game...
Very unoriginal. Too many ads. Just a .0000000000000000000000001 out of a million
Amusing enough in the early levels but later on bears little resemblance to anything resembling a real bridge. Designed to have you watching 4 ads per level with no chance of solving without the hints.
The game seemed alright even with the lack of sounds... But dang  how annoying as hell they force you to watch those 30sec ads that cant be cancelled. A 5sec ads is fine  but a 30sec force one? I immediately uninstalled the game.
It is not easy to build . 
This game was pretty cool and awesome but the thing is I cannot complete level 13 so thats my issue iam a boy actually so thats Im using my moms old phone but hey another new phone ldo my sister had a new phone her old sisters phone got broke of cuz of doing always mlbb but fix the level 13 but ...Full ReviewThis game was pretty cool and awesome but the thing is I cannot complete level 13 so thats my issue iam a boy actually so thats Im using my moms old phone but hey another new phone ldo my sister had a new phone her old sisters phone got broke of cuz of doing always mlbb but fix the level 13 but Im gonna redownload it back again anyways keep up the good work ( gonna copy jellies end outro skip(see you soon alligator in a while crocodile (huha) Google Play Most Innovative Game 2017  Winner

Reminds me of poly bridge  but is realy just a ripoff. There is alot of ads in it and it realy takes the fun out of it. (and the controls are wonky)

awesome game  i love just creating weird bridges on already  finished levels when i have unlimited money but building bridges on not  yet completed levels i also great. I really like and reccomend this game  so 5 stars goes to you all developers  )
Ads after every attempt  cant mute the ads initially so they pause your music or podcast every time. Also cant stop game from playing over other apps. Game was fun but because of above problems I uninstalled
this is great when I play this game im so busy playing this even there is ads I like funny if I crashed any cars that did not allow to crash the car so I will give 5 stars because its excellent and it always says remove something that is why I cant pass the level 9 because I need to remove something
I like the game and I understand and support ads which has been placed by the developer   but game hangs when it could not connect to server for playing ads . If the network is slow thats it I have to close and reopen the app .
The game is alright but for some reason it keeps on coming up with how I want to pay? I dont know if ur just trying to get money out of me or if it is a bug but please fix it because if it keeps on happening Im going to delete the game..
Its a great game and the fact that its free is a bonus I hear everyone moaning about the ads but what do you expect from a game that is free I mean they need to actually make money from it to keep it running. I love this game and appreciate everything from the developers! 
This game is awesome but  the reason I give this game a 3 STAR is because this is a really cool game.But we shouldnt have go use real money.And the building material is too expensive.
The game is polish and fun to play but when you fail a challenge an ad will pop up before you can restart your turn again which maked it even more frustrating. I uninstalled the game because of the ad placement.
Love the game. Is quite of entertaining and it keeps me busy trying to do challenge. I hate the ads  tho  it was not like this with ads when I begun playing it 3 yrs ago.
Great time waster and some tricky bridges to build with the limited material you have to use.
I got on and a black screen so i waited nothing ive played it before though its fun
Is this a carbon copy of the better game  (in my opinion) Poly Bridge? I mean the mechanics are very similiar and the thumbnail image thing they just changed a van to a taxi cab. I guess its free though.
I tryed the game for at least a day  the first few levels are fun and easy untill you reach level 10 I would like to keep it on my phone but this is just not my type of game  and thats my opinion sorry going to delete it .
Good game overall  the poly graphics looks cool.
i agree the level go from super easy 2 super hard this is a game that I think needs better work on. with tiny bit easier and maybe the control the little easy but I totally git it a 4.
From what I heard its a very hard or too easy game and theres too many ads often everything is a purchase example you need to pay to get to the next part of the game its very bad I do not recommend it
Amazing and addictive.. love the 3d  2d views as well.. so real and the colour changes of structures when load increases.. wow! What a game!! Eagerly Waiting for new free maps..
The game is great fun. From the starts it gets you building. The music and sound could still get some work  this however is not a problem.
It is super fun and I thought it would be easier but boy was I wrong it gets more and more difficult each levil
Its just the worst ripoff of poly Bridge Ive ever seen. It is filled with ads and tutorials that take forever. All in all its just a bad game that isnt worth your time.
Nice game. But!!! I have never seen any app with this many adverts.... Loooong adverts 30 seconds long thay you have to watch all of it. Its soo terribly annoying I am deleting the app right now.
Poly Bridge for mobile. No hydraulics and you have to stick to the grid  but its mobile so cant be too harsh. Very good game.
Cant disable or skip tutorial. Yes  I know how to build a bridge because all these games are the same  so let me just play the goddamn game.
The game is really fun but what irritates me more is that fact that there are to many ads that pop up mabye put ads every 10 min or so it does not affect us while we play
A good game but as level increases physics starts to die and only option is watch add and take hint  no sense
You cannot make your own bridge and you luckily do not have many ads
Hey look! Another bridge building game with basically no new features and forced ads and IAPs! You get a second star for decent graphics.
Worse level 9 is impossible  when I tried to see a ad and get 100 coins it wont work  totally awful
Its not good at all its 100 pay to win unless you want to play every level for a few hours.
Fun and detailed  BUT it has too many ads  and worst of all it looses multiple levels of progress data (even when backing up to the main menu and double checking progress before closing)
fantastic game. less finicky than polybridge so less frustrating. kinda crappy that i gotta buy the game all over again for the new levels tho. And i dont see how giving it 100 different names helps sell the game
I wish after you beat a level  you can replay it with an unlimited budget. Also  how about add hydrolics.
Not working properly. On level 3 its showing moving a piece. Ive tried it 30 times following the animation. Just keeps replaying the animation. So I will now uninstall as the frustration has driven me crazy!
I played it Coll and is make me fell like Im building a bridge IRL
Its okay it just runs a little slow though but apart from that its a fine game
I tried the game more  and now I have more complains. Mainly  if you fail too many times  IT SAYS THAT BOTH WOOD AND ROAD ARE ROAD! And  unrealistic physics  when something snaps  IT DISSAPEARS INTO THIN AIR!
This game is genuinely good. The ads are annoying so I paid a tenner to get rid of them. Well worth it. Its fun  it works well  it has good challenges.
So... this game crashed when i open it nothings wrong but it just crashing my game when the tutorial starts and it just make my pc crash and needed to restart i still wont uninstal it so pls notice this and fix this
Dont even waste your time on this game  its a bore. The controls arent even sensitive enough  and will skip when youre trying to place this happens offten
way too many ads  pretty greedy for money  game play is innovative with auto triangle structures as far as bridge games go. bit of a yawn and game play comes to a halt at level 20.
It a fun and free to play building experience for people that like to build things
Soo hard and not letting to see ads
pretty okay. the bridges are a bit odd to build being theres often not many anchor points. its impossible to get three stars on some levels unless you were to pay.
Cool game. However  after opening the game again (after reaching level 5) it started me pfd at level 1 again. Very frustrating.
In every level you need to do exactly what the devs did or els you wouldnt pass it  it makes the game very infuriating because you want to be creative but you just cant
its fun in all  but i gave it a four star bc its complacated and im in 3rd grade(basically)and i dont know what a iron chain thingy does.
The game is fun and sometimes complicated it gets your brain working and it teaches you pretty much how to build a bridge.
Fun game. Easy to get stuck early though. Only get 1 free hint. I would like a little more help in the beginning  but its cool.
Very few ads. Cool game. Sometimes you start to play a game and within about 10 minutes you know its a Yes if you know what I mean. This is one of those kinda games.
Not enough levels and needs a sandbox mode. Plus to many pop up ads  which is stupid because you have to pay to unlock more levels.
Good game because it is very fun and easy it looks like real life but not its just a game so Cool!!!! Like the cars the grass like everything it so fun good game !
Awesome game  but... we must pay to unlock levels ?? _ no i mean like if you already done all the maps you must pay to play the other maps. This game is very fun to play exept for the ads  Download now!!
I had a good experience with this game  it looks good  it doesnt have alot of ads (like some people say) and its a pretty hard game which I kinda like.
A very good game. dont play if youre frustrated this is more then that
Amazing game! Good graphics but not too many levels. It does take time to get to progress to 100 but we do need more levels.
The game is good but I remember playing this game years ago when people loved it. Now it is just losing fame.
It is a nice game it feels original but it neds more like sandbox mode.
Hope you like ads  not short ones either 30sec ones  every level  every restart. Not a horrible game and i understand the need for ads but this is excessive.
Absurd amount of adds (after each run  win or fail) with in app purchases as well. Too stingy for my taste and hard to get real pleasure wheb youre constantly interuptedconstantly.
too many ads! I would 1 star  but Im guilty of still playing the game at this time. please come up with an ad free payment option. I bet people will still watch ads for the free coins. reading the reviews  lots of folks are asking for the same thing.
I recently reinstalled this  and you get an ad after each trial!!! Imagine learning to play or building fun things to be bombarded by ad after ad. Download something else.
So many ads  it sucks the fun right out. Fail  get an ad  just beat a hard level  celebrate while you watch this ad  had to test your bridge  how about an ad.
A very good game of you like games with construction and physics.
Please stop spamming the  stuck on a bridge its really irritating  let me play in peace. i paid to stop the ads  it really is unplayable otherwise.
Just a poly bridge Rip off   do not download   better get poly bridge so so much fun and better
I love it. Good bridge builders are hard to find and this is one of them Good graphics  in app purchases for cool stuff and easy to play!
I think this game is good but its a little bit like you you have to figure out how how to get the car across so it wont fall into the water and the 5th falls into the water at you die and you have to do it all over again
It is really good but the only problem is when you run out of levels
It sucks. The levels can be too hard or too easy  and everytime I lose or win and ad shows up. This game freaking SUCKS.
The ads once every few minutes really piss me off. Im so sick of the greed of these stupid games. You should find another way to monetize instead of ruining the experience your game tries to create. It defeats the purpose.
Quite fun and not to many ads and really fun  its pretty easy.
Easy time waste  so many ads. Not worth the frustration.
Hello! Its a very nice game  no problems at all. Theres not much ads and Im happy about it because it wont distract me. Continue on the good work!!
Android 9. Not loading. Connecting to Google Play and then it stops there with the circle. My other games have no issues connecting to Google Play. I have more than one Google accounts. Could be the cause of the failure.
Meh  1 main complaint  I would of completed half if the driver would slow the f down  it just floors on my bridge and it snaps. Speed limit? Controls need alot of work on sensitivity  to fast.
I am making the stuped tiranagels but the wood is made out of gramcrackers pleaz make the wood stronger. But i still like this game.
Sux. Take a page from Portal Bridge for your controls and loosen up the amount of 3 star bridges regarding possibilities. Not 1 way to do it.
Dont know why and who made this scrap lebelled as Editors choice. I was Stucked on level 3 and there were no exit option. Third class gameplay. Dont install it  just wastage of data and time.
When I was playing levels some of them are so hard its so insane and when I waste my coins when I buy a hint the hit doesnt even work it does not make sense show me I will never buy this never get it never even get the game ever in my life
This game is a well made puzzle game thats pretty fun to play when passing time or waiting for the bus  or when you wait for your mom to finally choose the one dress shes looking for.
Just... To many ads  we know ads for your support  but using it too much irritating the players. Ads every level completed.
Nice game  but the graphics feel just a bit dated. Everything else about it is cool  good concept and fun.
Nice app  but the ad wall is unbearable. Make a mistake  ad. Next level  ad. Hit back by mistake  ad. Open the app  ad. No quality of life in playing this.
Get hydraulics its the most important part of the bridge and after some fails theres a 5050 chance it will give you an ad good game but I recommend you just get the real poly bridge for 0.99 on phone
best bridge building game on the market. if youre into these types of games would be crazy to pass up on one like this. do yourself a favor and download this game while its still free
Solid game with very few bugs  but a LOT of ads. I wish there was a way to purchase it adfree.
Okay. Wow. It crashes so much that you can barely play it  there are an insane amount of ads  it. Is bad. But at least the gameplay and physics are.. enjoyable...
This is a great game still it has some minor bugs to fix... Sometimes it just freezes thats it ..totally it is good .I like it.
Very nice graphics.
Controlling where you can put bridge struts etc  is all over the place  and ads are too in your face! Otherwise quite good!
its a fun and challenging game where you learn the mechanics of buiding a bridge (obiously) as well as learn physics. also the main menu music is dope
Nice game  but only 30 levels please increase the level a I played all add more 1000 levels please please please please...
The gameplay first time easy but next next levels are very big and very strong .because nice game.I just like 3 stars out of 2.the game graphics are very good and gameplay nice but levels are big.

LOVE this game works amazing  great graphics  runs perfectly  doesnt need internet  great time killer  and little to no ads. WOULD RECOMMEND
discusting this gam esuck theres to many ads the game only wants to get payed they made a pretty simple game so they can get money and u have to buy alot of stuff I really hate it I was a fan 12 years ago but now it sucks
There are few glitches in the game like when the game is closed suddenly. Even completed levels disappeat. Need more new levels.
Its so cool to so cars go over your creation and if it fail its also fun to see your bridge collapse with the car but I like the game and its really fun.
Im not sure what the purpose of the game is yeah you need too cross the bridge but it doesnt show toturiols on how too. And mabey the coins Option is kinda dumb and a waste of money but overall the game can be calming if played right not much of a kids game either
Way too many ads. Ridiculous that you spend the most time watching ads than playing the game. Uninstalled within 30 minutes after downloading.
Fun. But needs more levels and a little more strategy into some levels for example  NOT a straight line to the finish.
Its a good game  Its just that the ads get really annoying and repetitive. I would give a 5 star but again  the ads.
Its not that Im trash at this but the game is way to hard for almost anyone to complete any levels without using all the hints. Dont get this unless you like to think your trash.
Screen stays black everytime I try to load. Never got to even see what this game looks like. Please fix because I want to play this game
Its fun but I hate how you only have a certain amount of money available so if you want to go crazy and make something big and cool you cant other than that good game expect there are ads every level
It is fun  I wish there was more than 30 levels for the people who do not have extra money for the other worlds. It is overall  a good game
Its a very nice game with great physics  reccomend it to people bored in lockdown! PS. I dont care about it being a rip off of poly bridge.
so many ads every time you play there is an ad. so annoying also the price is too much you guys are seriously gold grabbers you make money by ads then make money for playere to buy your stupid pack to have other levels again so stupid
this is a great game and one of the reasons i found this is because of on youtube someone played it and it seemed very amazing how you can perform amazing tricks and other things
How is the fricker editers choice? This Polybridge ripoff  full of spyware  adinfested game is arse.
It was good at the beginning until I realized whenever you tried to run the level  the hint button was on top of the run level button so I couldnt play it. Would not reccomend downloading it.
Im doing this on computer  but for tutoral  my Stop Similator wont show because my screen is small. Plz fix it  but good game. keep it up!!!
This game has a lot of cool cars and is challenging for those who like challenges
Good game  but if you honestly want people to buy the dlc charge 13 dollars for it. Im suprised people will pay 10 for a full game let alone extra levels.
Such a bad game i never paly this game at all i say dont download it that bridge that had made by developer of game has make bridge to complete level I have also to make same to complete the level such a bad game after playing this game i never download any game by this boobmit games 
this game is hard but very fun. you need to build a brige to get the car to the next side.there is a new game pass where you could travel to space and it is 15.00.
Well as a game its quite fun  but Im giving it a 1 star because when Im trying to play a level  it crashes every single time. Ive tried restarting my phone  but it did not work at all. Please fix this issue.

Placement? Isnt where you tap. Strength of items? Unfairly weak. Pay2win? No. Freemium? Yes. Dont play  go play poly bridge 2.
Great game  but I got a game breaking glitch  game stops running every time I try to play a level.
fun at the start but it gets boring and repetitive after some time  too many ads  difficult to control when building and some levels are impossible to get 3 stars
it is some time hard but if you get uses to it then it feels like a good game thats why I gave it 4 stars theres one more thing missing in the game I cant quite put my finger on it
Cant play at all if I try to click a button an ad pops up and its super annoying and also if the game owners respond to this then heres my answer No I dont want to pay for no ads that would be wasting my money and you copied poly brige
The game doesnt want to install AT ALL. I am tired of waiting for it to install. I even tried to tap cancel but it just wont stop installing nonstop. If i can give it zero stars it would be better.
You guys were unable to save my progress  also  Ive tried two times to reach where I stopped playing last time. It is impossible to play a long game with a failure like that.

Good game but after level 7 it is full of ads and must pay for that space thing every were the bridge koms down and the jump is almost impossible!!
RIPOFF OF POLY BRIDGE poly Bridge is a great game and they come in with this garbage it take a million years to load a level and they literally toke a screenshot of poly Bridge and put everything where it is in poly bridge there are no differences its copywrite garbage
I cant even pass the tutorial. One minute after started they told me to press the stop button  but the button never showed up.
This game is very fun. Challenging you by limiting the amount of money you can use is also very cool. I also like the art style.
This is an amazing game. There are very few ads and the game is extremely satisfying. It is basically a clone of Poly Bridge.
really fun when i played it 6 months ago. since then  its said more levels coming soon and im stuck at 50 completion... please finish the app  great bridge building game!
It was a fun game however i bought a bunch of stuff and my phone reset and it was all lost so i spent like 30 for nothing and at this point i dont ever wanna play it again until i get my stuff back
Its so fun thanks for making like a type of free poly bridge I like poly bridge but it cost money this account does not have money my other account needs to be verified this is the best game ever I like the ads to
There is always ads it trying to be poly bridge and it totally suks theres ads if you fail or complete any level never make a game again developers unless it dose not have ads and levels are really good plz
It is poly bridge for free  and that is awesome. The adds are a bit annoying but not as bad as people say they are.
Perfect level of difficulty throughout. Always makes you wanna keep playing. Good and fun exercise for your brain.
Controls are just poorly done  does not follow my finger and I barely had the patience to finish the first level  this is basic stuff. (Huawei p20)
Awesome game Good to pass time.. The graphics should be improved though.... Levels soon become challenging and will keep you interested..
Controlls very poorly  part placements are never anywhere near that Im pressing. Phone screen is clean and no other games have this issue.
Very fun! Love the side challenges. Reminds me of building the bridges out of popsicle sticks in high school  to get the car across without it breaking 
I love this game personal favorite game just I wish they would make more levels and stop focusing on the packs you have to buy.
Decent game but without paying exstra money it doesnt have a lot of content and the pay to play Co tent is kinda expensive for what it is
Thanks for making this game its sucks sometimes your mission is impossible to do a three star my mission to build a bridge am to use only 4500 money or less how can i build a bridge so long that money is to small please dont download this its suck really suck
This is the best game ever it is the perperfect if you do not want to download poly bridge
Excellent game very simple I hope theres a build a bridge 2
this is basically a simpler version of poly bridge...4 stars because there are still bugs to work out
Its buggy. It doesnt even save the progress. Everytime i close the app the progress of previous level is lost. Its putting me off enough to uninstall the game.
Great game  I played this game continuosly for 2hours... smooth gameplay but controls are little bit glitchy.....game needs some optimization... over all game is excellent  can you add some more vehicles plss
Its a good game  but battery optimizations arent really there. So it tends to kill the battery quicker.
I like the game  but too many ads. I wasnt able to paly more than 1 game before fing ads show up.
Good game but stopped playing it due to way too many adverts  and they are full video adverts as well. Change this and Ill change my rating.
This is a clear cash grab rip off of poly bridge and pretty much every 30 seconds theres an add for another game and every minute theres an add to buy something on this game. You should not buy this game and instead look for another game.
Hint popup is annoying  and cliffs are not solid structures (bridge partssupports go right through them like butter).
Awesome but only 30 levels. levels are around 100  200
Very nice. The controls to make the bridge are a wee bit hard. Just a simple free version of polly bridge.
I like so much first its hard but i used brain then its easy I give 5 star also offline nice game
The good old polybridge formula is fun  now with annoying tutorials that make you click every button one by one and try to finish levels for you and full screen ads!

This game Tutorial Bridge a game of much this game or something time jump more no down good up here PvP it best this game Screen this game but Im not sure what if you do have the right to be MacBook pro shop you have game Tutorial
i think its a great way to pass the time  some levels are actually quite tricky to get 3 stars on too which is really good to see
Good and cool things to build
The game is alright but the adds are trash. Ive been trying to get of an add for 5 minutes now but every time I press the X to get of it it takes me to Google play page.
It would be a good game if the phisics was improved and less adds but the main problems is the phisics as I have done mechanics at a level and how tention works i realised it was off so I hope you find this helpful
it was fun but at level 6 it was old redy hard and ive played the first leval somany times i couldent find out how to play this game i hade to use the hint in every level.
10 seconds into playing and Im already seeing an ad. One of those games that just spams tf out of you with ads. Not worth playing.
When I would try and build I would have to hold my finger roughly half an inch underneath and it caused a lot of inconsistencies when I was trying to build
This game is very good  it helps fu ou understand basic laws of physics and how it affects the surrounding areas.
Had this game on my phone for ages  New levels coming soon So  when is soon. Cant progress any further now.
They make you watch adds to play more levels and the building seems like I am doing it on 5 fps. My phone is just fine  the game is just bad.
this game it very fun and is a little hard to play without a mouse. but that my only complain... but it is because im playing on a chromebook  so android people should not have a problem. and there are no ads so no intuptions.
Touch accuracy can be a little finicky  but easy to fix mistakes. Otherwise  fantastic bridge builder!
It is challenging! And its very well put out graphics are good and it uses thinking forward. I recommend it. 
its like poly bridge but I deleted all my data on the game so I am going to leave a good rate so they think I like the game but i really dont like it. so thank you for reminding me about poly bridge it cost money so thanks alot build a bridge uuuuhhhhhgggg......Full Reviewits like poly bridge but I deleted all my data on the game so I am going to leave a good rate so they think I like the game but i really dont like it. so thank you for reminding me about poly bridge it cost money so thanks alot build a bridge uuuuhhhhhgggg...Google Play Most Innovative Game 2017  Winner        
I love this game theres no ads on me everythings not on my just playing the game and i love it and the tutorial i was first try and the good thing about that game is theres no ads still
Fun Game Poor Experience The game makes it very challenging to make an actual bridge. The game was fun and had okay experience.
Too many ads. I can accept watching an ad every time you pass a level  but having to watch one on every failed attempt as well is too annoying
Good game without any lag crash hang
This game is fun until level 13 when they give you nothing to build on even the hint build it for me doesnt work  overall I dont like it
Pretty fun game. the ads can be annoying at times but the devs gotta make money so I understand.
This game is fun. Anyone complaing about lag is wrong they probably just have a bad device. It is fun and if you just turn your WiFi you wont get ads.
Its a nice alternative to poly bridge. Its also free. Didnt mind about the ads.
Its a great game for taking a break from working at home. The only issue is the constant adverts every five minuets
Nice game  but so may ads  and no option to remove them by buying the game. stopped playing it.
Ripoff of Polly Bridge  not a good one at that. Laggy  horrible interface. Id rather have my fingers jammed into a grinder for 10 minutes then play this game for 1.
This game is pretty easy not much ads i love this game! Its pretty easy to get used to
Great job on your game. Its perfect and looks good. The game eventualy gets to be pretty hard though.
this game is suck  bcause the tutorial got a bug  the bug is cant press stop button while the car is stuck. so i cant playing this game.
Whoever says this is only a copy of Poly Bridge  then heshe is wrong because release date of Build a Bridge! is 2017 while release date of Poly Bridge is 2018)
I hate this game because ads every couple of seconds and this is a replicate of poly Bridge like exactly the same... DONT RECOMMED PLAYING
Garbage  the third level is unbeatable  controls are annoying. Overall a garbage ripoff of poly bridge.
Great game  it should have option for storing the lowest cost bridge which actually worked. Just saying
30 seconds of ads for every 20ish seconds of gameplay... Fun game but you spend more time watching ads than playing.
This is just poly bridge but the physics are not as you expect and it completely screws you over. Do yourself a favour and please dont play this game.
Its a good game but the adds need too go down every time u lose or something u have too watch an add even when u win have too watch a add it would be a 5 star with out the adds get rid of more adds
fantastic  well polished app! The graphics and game mechanics are simply amazing and offer hours of fun gameplay!
Weird controls  random popup ads when trying to make a bridge and in game purchases are too in your face
Game doesnt even work. Took 2 restarts and a force close just to even get it to open then once it actually started it now wont let me do anything  cant press or do anything??
Cool game I a bit lazy so small review
this was a wonderful game up untill the game reset all of my progres if you download it play it on airiplane mode or of line so you dont get any ads
Its amazing you trained your skill of building a bridge by using your mind and thinking of how you can cross a car to poin A to point B. Its amazing and cool game too.
To many ads  the ads make my phone lag  I see people give 12 star  I give you a 4 star I hope you can Remove the ads!!
Too many extremely intrusive ads.. Totally ruins the experience.. I would rather pay upfront for an item than goung for so many IAPs..
Very good! Could use more building materials. Maybe somethings similar to poly Bridge  45!
Super fun and when you have so much money. Over all its super duper fun
Its great but the problem is that every time you tap on a level  it takes 25 minutes for it to load.
The games good but the optimisation is very poor. I have a SD 625 and have to play at very low graphics to play the game.
Too many ads!! Uninstalled... so many ads that are so long (and loud) you cant hardly tell if the game itself is worth anything.
You see  Its a game where you can complete a level then replay it because it was fun. But at the end its nice.
So many adds!!!!Also many of the levels and worlds are locked.The other features are good.
Great game. Hard puzzles. Wish I could use the galaxy note pen for it but it doesnt work most of the time.
Very time consuming game. Very similar to other bridge games on Android and PC. Definitely Recommend.
Just poly bridge but with worse physics  less effort and infinite adds but hey its free so it wont hurt your heart to unistall it.
I love this app but it had started not responding when I go on it it crashes and my phone says the game is not responding and it isnt my phone because my phone Is great and I have the best settings turned on and the rest of my apps are working fine and when I say that I mean I cant even play the a...Full ReviewI love this app but it had started not responding when I go on it it crashes and my phone says the game is not responding and it isnt my phone because my phone Is great and I have the best settings turned on and the rest of my apps are working fine and when I say that I mean I cant even play the app when I press on it it doesnt even load it just says the name of the app isnt responding please try fix this issue bc I love the game and i will definitely change my review to 5 starsGoogle Play Most Innovative Game 2017  Winner        
This app is garbage. Hard to lay pieces precisely  ads coming out the ass and finally  it just quit working.
Too easy to build bridges with the auto support function when building supports. Has way to many ads.
Awesome. Great fun  reasonable ads  no need (so far) to break into premium purchases.
This game is like a bridge building game thats only on pc  but its on mobile. Ive wanted a game like this for a while and now I have it. I definitely recommend.
The gameplay is great  but ads and inapp purchase offers make it unplayable.
Its a fun game but a killer on battery and the ads are horrendous which is unfortunate.
There should be a clear button or something to skip the stupid tutorial. Its insulting to peoples intelligence its not that hard to learn such a basic game ffs
Fun and addicting game. Very challenging... Adds kill the game though. Cant give higher than 3 because of it
Love this game best game Ive ever had I always play it very satisfying and addictive. Its going to release a new update soon too.
played a few levels so far. always loved the classic build a bridge physics games but those seem retro compared to this. enjoying it so far
The game is nice I play that for 3 years  and I never bord If I complete I uninstalled that game and intalled again
can you turn the coming soon levels into actual levels? Im tired of playing the same levels over and over every single day.
Love it basically a free polybridge or harder version and the first 4 levels are tutorials but if the levels are a bit more easy then 5 STARS
Good game . But you allways need to wach ads to play. Even to unlock levels.
well designed  i kept having to relaunch the game if its in the background. my phone has 4GB of ram dunno if this happens for others.
Too many ads. Ads lock you out or force you onto download page. Game is not bad. Id buy It cheap.
Nice game... But i found it very difficult to play after some 10 or 11 levels i mean really hard and to get a hint you must watch add...
Great game  its the bridge game Markiplier played  except with touch screen  making things even harder.
I have been playing for five minutes. Force me to rate your game after more time would be great. But so far I am enjoying.
Bugs everywhere. Worst game. It starts with level 1 everytime I open this game. Dont download
ridiculous  after each 30 second level a 30 sec ad... duck off

You could make the game trigger an ad by every click  how do you miss that??
dont bother  its just ads unless you pay. cant comment on the game play because i refuse to watch a 30 second trailer. not safe for kids unless you condone graphic violence in the ads.
Fun and challenging game. But certain pop up leave you one tap away from spending 10 on a mobile app. Pretty annoying
It is a good game but only for those who like slow paced games and it is very slow in nature.
Glitchy bad graphics......just a free knockoff version of the original bridge building game its a waste of time
This game is AMAZING the 3D features and the quality is really good and not that many ads.
its good but i have problem with the ads because i wasnt able to go back to the game after the ad is completed
When I started the fourth level its super difficult!!! Its just difficult because everything I try just ends up with the bridge breaking! I dont get it!!! 
BIG GLITCH!!! Ive spent numerous hours getting to level 30  and every day it sends me back to a previousold level. Has NO memory of where I left the game even when those rounds have bridges built from my previous successful attempts.
I will not play this game because of i wanted to do that i would go play Poly Bridge  which  by the way  this is an excellent RIP OFF of.
Used to be a great experience  now its just loaded with ads and paywall nonsense.
Good game  but ads are to long (30 seconds) and some break the game.
I love this game but please make more levels and can you make an update that we can have a choice to make the bride move like poly bridge 
I saw this game and i thought meh then my brother started playing it and i was like wow but some of the levels are frikin hard
There is another one of this game and this ones kind of boring  and its quiet lagging and if I like the other game then Ill just want to not play it put it cost money  I do want to spend my money and Im not spending all my money just because of that game
I dont know why i go for 5 stars but nice game i dont want to tell you more because i want to play the game now bye
Something is wrong with the touch controls. When you try to draw a line you always end up on a wrong spot.
Just plain fun! Allows for MULTIPLE WAYS TO SOLVE EACH PUZZLE! Most games only have 1 or 2 right answers  this had Tons!
This game is best and interesting like how you build and construct the bridge how the ships go thats why i would give this 5 stars those you guys didnt download it go and download this game
The game is great but there is one flaw  too many ads!!!
good tests of skill  but often overly simplistic and impossible to make some screens cancel. you get forced into choices you didnt intend
The game isnt that great I got bored from it quickly when I installed it I knew it wont be good but when I installed it turned out to be worse than what I expected the game isnt for my age but I think kids will have some fun with it
Very good game but only get to do like 6 levels then you have to pay for next level.
An extreme cheat of a game you have to give real money to unlock the new locations and they dont let is make any bridge of our choice we have to make the bridge they want
Horrible  absolutely terrible game design  I used a thw hints and the car still couldnt make it across  terrible game.
The game itself is fun  but dont pay for anything in app  coins dont actually generate and progress doesnt save most times
nice game  but shows ads after each level and has no option to buy the game game and remove them
very fun because you can be as creative as you want with the structure of the bridges and also pretty good graphics
super fun u just need one thing like a creator for creating your own car and character have fun playing this u guys thx so much and go watch my youtube channel The other guy but u need to put the settings to channels have fun be safe and love this game
Just a fake of poly bridge and its worse  I liked the effort to atleast make it close to poly bridge.
The game is a horrible COPY of poly bridge just with a paywall and loads of advertisements after each level and after each failed attempt
Still the best bridge building game on mobile nothing can touch this in my book simple enough to keep you interested yet complex enough to keep you engaged great game love it.
Great fun game as you can make whatever type of bridge you want with different materials as you progress.
unskippable ad is taking it a bit too far. its already plagued with many pay to win stuff. which many csm ignore. now this? come on man
Im gonna say before playing this  it looks like a poly bridge ripoff  a very good poly bridge ripoff.
This is awesome some level are hard and some are not theres 100 levels and its good I love it so much.
This game is great if you want a little challenge and its great if you need to spend time!!! Great game!
Physics are not consistent. Good idea  poor execution.
Cool game  it an alternative to poly Bridge if people dontcant pay. Although not as good. Overall great game!
Interesting but does not work with the Galaxy Tab pen. So its back to the Fat Finger problems. Therefore too clunky ... delete ... (
30 second ads? A buy this new world message that never goes away? Come on.
This game i would not give it a 5 star it took forever to load it took 8 minutes and it still didnt load
This has been my favorite game ever but they dont have enough levels to play on I hope they make more soon I look forward for future content
So. Many. Ads! Put fewer ads in the game and people will play it longer and watch more ads.
I like this game because its similar to the original poly bridge its basically like the free version of ploy bridge
Way to many ads. Game is fun  but ad after ad makes it very annoying to play.
Great game just as good as the real thing that you have to pay for!!! this is free and just as Good I rate its app 
Gameplay is brilliant  sad ads are annoying. Uninstalled after ads freezed the game.
Amazing only problem is that it keeps on asking me to check out the new world which is REALLY annoying.
just garbage  there are too many ads and then you need an excessive amount of coins because they give you the hard missions early on
I love the graphics but the wait time to get te each lvl is like a minute but I admite this has the best graphics yet!
too many ads and making good supports is impossible  making triangles are useless and I gives you no joints to build off of.
I rate this app 1 star because it takes to long and it extremely boring besides its to easy make it hard.
The best game there is to spend a little bit of time while waiting for something and is a stress reliever sometimes!!
Even during the tutorial it was glitchy. Uninstalled now.
I really like the game and played it all the time but then the bugs came and it ruin my mood to play it...good effort tho
Limited funds  they expect you to do this with the minimum amount of money. It would be better if you had extra  but could get better scores by rebuilding cheaper.
fun  relaxing game. not super easy  but clues are helpful when you need them
It was so fun and easy for me but I wish there would be more levels  besides the ones that cost money .
the game is cool but the controls are confuseing like the moving and the placeing. and add titaniam
Excellant game but no longer playable  it keeps crashing. Would hate to lose my progress if I have to reinstall
Its a cool game but Im 15 almost 16 and I cant build a bridge to get three stars.
Some bridges are really challenging to build. But still pretty addictive game.
The game itself is good but every time I pass a level I get an add and the game wont let me pass level 6 it kicks me out of the game
Worst Worst Worst Experience .. Too many adds. literally after every step played there is 30 sec add ... What the hell wrong with you guys .. I will never going to install this game again ..... 
This game is fun but for level4 be careful The hint is glitch with the moving button I DONT LIKE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Maybe its just my phone but even following the tutorial the bridge wont connect.
I dont care how good the game is  30 second unskippable ads every 5 minutes is ridiculous.
This is just great! No ads  i really like the graphics.
This game looks exactly like poly bridge and witch I can play on my switch so theres no point in buying this game on mobile.
Best game with cars its like you get a car game make it 3d and cartoony and then add money and levels and the sandbox aspect and boom you get this 55
Its a good game but it needs a mode where you have unlimited money and you can build any type of bridge you want.
Its a cheap Poly Bridge clone with ads spammed everywhere. If you want a better Version  Check Poly Bridge or Poly Bridge 2
way to many ads and lets be honest anybody playing this game is doing it because poly bridge costs money
For those who know their bridge games  this one is like poly bridge but free. By far the best free bridge game
You couldnt rip polybridge off harder. controls are horrible. worse than the poly brige APKs out there.
This game is pay to win  I hate it. Poly bridge is better than this crappy game full of ads
Ads were very difficult to close when started. I accidentally clicked many times.
just lost all my levels !!! I dont know why... the game was ok played offline to avoid the ads
Really nice game! Lots of ads though... but still playable.
Such a lovely game! Have never personally experienced problems  and it is quite relaxing.
Alright  but its a blatant ripoff of the game Poly Bridge on Steam.
This game is so fun Im so happy I found it and you can make jumps little loops and its real
This game is very hard but i like it
good game overall and I and meny other people like thease construction games. there could be a sandbox mode though 
As a beta tester ive never felt playing while building a bridge and lags and then quits the app by itself 2018 was normal to play it and now 2019 its gotten worse report bugs found program functionbrokenlose control
could be better in graphics but really good job in the controls but need to develop better graphics for the levels
Good game  graphics are OP  and the physics is too good no glitches found till yet  and i even started to like this game even though i am a PUBG player........
Nice game. Just consider helping players at the start a bit more rather than asking us to watch videos for hints.
I got to level 18  and when I closed the app  it erased all of my progress and started me back at level 1  I had a stable connection to wifi both times and was signed in to Google play. Awful game and now Im deleting it.
Good but needs better controls and also the levels need to be simpler
This game is a good game... but it is just a copy of PolyBridge but poly bridge costs 89 p and has 100k downloads AND dosent work on samsung galaxy s4.
this is a very great game because the graphics and how when you put down a pice of wood it tells you where you need to support it.
Ads  ads  ads. Slow performance.
Confusing  too easy  not too many levels
So far  excellent! I would change to 1 if disappointed by later freemium  otherwise is awesome
I would love this game  it has a fun concept and nice graphics. BUT THE CONTROLS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO USE
Fun and challenging. Some levels feel geared to making you spend money to beat but fun overall
controls are difficult to use. game is heavily oriented around earning profit for the developers. its obviously not made by people who love games.
Cool and please add more stuffs life money for rm.100 and a helicopter which you need to land on and a plane and jump over the plane and the boat
I wanted to build under attaching to the rocks on the side ... I really just downloaded to test out a idea I had but couldnt as they wont attach
The absolute worst game I ever played I loaded so SLOW. There were ads every single second. I do not recommend to anyone because its so bad

cant play  only the starting (loadings) is going on. (only clouds are moving.) plz help.
fun but lagging on my device  long load times  delayed controls  but game itself is good
The Game play is horrible super slow does not respond do nor download
Gameplay is not good and the way of the screen rotates is kind of f up
I loved the game and concept but non skipable full length ads are simply unexcusable.
Very enjoyable and creative game  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who engineering or just creating overall
It is better than poly bridge and poly bridge 2 because it is free but please put in it sandbox to give you five stars
its really hard when I used a hint on level 15 half bridge it dont work
This game is fun and is a great time killer.it feels like im playing poly bridge.
If I could I would give this game zero Stars it is a ripoff it says everything is free when the prices are high dont install this game its just a big scam!
I really like this game this is pretty good I really enjoy
Op game this is like poly bored I like it
standard bridge builder  controls are okay  theres help for some harder levels  good challenge
Pretty good but it should have some updates its been a long time
nice game  but 2 very anoying things 1. I am forced to watch ads way too frequently 2. my phone overheats a lot
It looks good but I cant load in or it takes too long thus need s to be fixed.
Good concept but bad design. The game feels slow and buttons overlap making it hard to play.
App is fun but a 30 second ad after every try is just toooooo much. Uninstalled it.
Ui slow and not accurate enough.
Pretty much the free version of Polly bridge  and controls are almost the same.
Cool game but could have better graphics
too many Ads. I get you want paid but give the end user a break. too many ads delete
Good game but adverts are a little too frequent and upgradea are way too expensive.
Game dosent save sometimes and loses a bunch of progress. Also tons of ads!
Took forever to download but its fun) By the way it is frustra
improve animation in this game.
Awesome game but you should add a sandbox level
Its my favorite game but  if you just try to fix the graphics  make some beautiful updates it will be a legendery game
Good game but slow sometimes but still good and fun. There should be a free play
this game is good but I cant complete level 8 It was very hard and 5 level is very fantastic
This game is cool like poly bridge I hope there will be a sandbox mode too but I enjoy I like it Thank You You
ads are too frequent  its annoying  i uninstalled a few levels after an hour
Hello  I really appreciate your efforts  but I hope you will simplify the game a little because it is very difficult
some time its unable to build a bridge. until we dont use hint. it irritates sometimes. but I like it.
While technically a straight ripoff of Poly bridge  its great since its free!
Very good experience with game itself ads more frequent than I would like
this game is pretty fun.you gotta use your brain to see how your gonna build the bridge the higher level you get the harder it gets
Its great can you add sandbox so you acn test out so many random things like a moving bridge And its great for learning
Laggy and constantly black screens and does nothing until I double press the power button on my phone.
Too many ads. And very boring
Its fun to play and its a time killer the only thing I dont like is the ads
its a cool game but the roads shouldnt break so easily  honestly I spent a week on 1 level because the roads broke so easily. uninstalled.
i get it that you need ads to fund the game  but forcing 30 seconds each time....
I have like the game alonglong time but the point why i put 4 stars its when the bridge needs more materials that the hard part to complete the game
Great game but poor player interface design  very difficult to use without a stylus
Poly bridge rip off with too many adds why are these games high rated? Bots?
Great game but why there is many ads hard levels why you want money for opinning another mode
best game i suggest to make a multiplayer build battle.good game nice work.i wanted to give 10 pretty good game
good game but when too muchbcomplicated bridge is built  graphics lags very much
Graphics and Gameplay are top notch and we need new more levels and In the next update pls make the space levels free
Why everyone keep saying this game copy poly bridge? Listen  this game release in 2017 (check game info in the google play discribetion (Im bad at english OK?)  and Poly Bridge release in 2018. Now ya see whos the copy cat? )
Way too many ads  seriously  one every 2 minutes. Disgusting. Its a shame because the game is not bad.
Bit too ad spammy and the placing controls are a bit clunky. But not a bad game.
Doesnt load on note 9 only only functions as a screen saver and battery drainer.
Too many ads  imprecise controls  no stylus support
This is just a copy of polybridge but with ads instead of 89 pence price
Its ok but the controls can be a little fiddly when trying to build 4 STARS
Not realistic  the designs they pick are just so you pay for hints and they follow no logic. as an engineer this app is pretty much a guessing game
Good Game! I could give it a 5 star but hint from ads is not working for me FeelsBadMan XD
Love this game I wanted poly bridge but I couldnt get it so I got build a Bridge and I finely got poly bridge and I still like build a Bridge more
This is a trash kind of game it always break the bridge in lvl 10 u cant finish it it always rerotating the car it always breaking the bridge and rerotating darn i hate this dont download it
You spend more time waiting for ads to finish than playing the levels.
Plays well enough  but no ad removal when purchasing extra worlds is insanity.
bad bridge game is better than this and is almost same like poly bridge it has hydraulics and everything tha poly bridge has
Good game  and also graphics is very good. Five stars.
No way to disable the stupid come play the game notifications. I would like to have this on my phone for the times that I want to play it but I cant because of this. Greedy devs
This game is fun and I like it Im already hooked and Im still on one of the first levels and its already so fun
Its a great game but when I get to level 3 its super hard so fix it
Fun game to pass the time. It does NOT push adds or purchases on you!
My game is just crashing when I play a little bit it just goes black and Im back to my home screen please fix this
Guys Im playing it again means I got to max level like at max build a bridge game is amazing I got to full level and Im plqying again its super awsome dawnload it now
Jeez stop shoving microtransactions into my face along with ads  its basically unplayable.
Frustrating to try and click the dots to make anything. This game sucks!
I mean like its about as great as poly bridge so thats why Im eating it a five star good graphics and very funny
Its grate but Im tired of this game its so hard the level go harder and then its really hard to build with not much buget
Im really sick of ads and inapp purchases. They ruin an otherwise great game.
i love this one but the ads is too hurt but i like thi game too much fun!
It would be fun if it werent so laggy. Its very simple so I dont know why it lags do much.
Its a great game if you are interested in killing some time. The game in general is a really fun game! Five Stars
I love this game but could you please make it a bit more easier to beat.
Feels like a bad rip off of poly bridge not gonna lie the physics are broken as well.
Forced Ads? Nope. Thats easy uninstall and 1 star right there.
I dont seem to have any ads which I like and the game is pretty hard. Ill keep it. 3
Ads are overwhelming  game was fun til I had enough of the ads.
I hate this game call this stupid game ad game ya because it lags it has ads everywhere it break like stupid game
Good cartoons and nice strategy  good if you are stuck in traffic!
Great game although I find literally everything hard but its still fun and I love it
Controls like dragging building materials could use some improvement.
just a copy of poly bridge but is still fun no 5 stars tho.
Its very good but I have a glitch all of my coins are gone
Horrible it doesnt have a tutorials you can look into it tells you stuff do to without telling you how to do it never getting a game from these creators again
Great game! the only issue i have is that the expansion is a little expensive for a mobile game.
Why me game start say I confirm privacy me not click find thing any me game again. I dont know you not good I dont give 5 star enough sorry now deleted
Its a good game is generally just make more materials in it like Brick and other stuff
Whenever i got to the third level it WOULD NOT LET ME MOVE THE ELEMENTS OF THE BRIDGE. Instead i got stuck. Do not download this app
There is nothing really wrong with this game other than the controls are painfull to say the least.
The game is pretty laggy...and it randomly closes out for no garenteed meaning at all. uninstalling.
Calm. Down. With. Your. Tutorials. Ffs I cant play a mobile game without having my hand held like a toddler.
So there was a problem  i was playing in level 12 or 24 and for some reason it earesed all my process and no i did not click the earase al data buton and now im going to uninstall this app and give this a bad coment i used to love playing this now i dont..
Incredibly hard and when you put wood it still falls and the cars randomly turns and everything for no reason falls
Awful controlinputs. Your finger has to be a good half centimeter from what youre trying to select.
when you go over budget  it doesnt let you build any more. I rate this game 3 stars.
Well it says your car is stuck and then it says press the stop button but it fades away
I was quite surprised to see that you can actually play a game between these ads
Horrible game cant beat the levels dont waste your time on the game
And yet another cheesy app designed for a 10 year old with special needs
This Game is Awesome! Great Graphics  No Ads  and its very amusing.
Bruh so many ads I know people say that a lot but really just before and after a level and you fail boom ads
Not bad but its kinda a ripoff of poly bridge
needs more free levels  this is a free game. why should I pay 10 for more levels?
So much ads but I like it but I wanted poly but it was money so I show this I like well
If youre looking for a free version of poly Bridge this is your game.
It is fun get the graphics are good and cars and cool maps and you have to make a bridge
Great game touch sense is way out for meto place something in the middle of the screen I touch at the bottom
Combination of strategy and intellegance  overall good gameplay experience.
Why isnt this made by the poly bridge creaters? How is such a bridge game possible without them?
My review is so low because this game is not original. It is a copy of Poly Bridge.
Its really creative and it is like an exgicational game because it teaches you More about grafics
This game is so good that it can tell us how to construct the bridge. Thats why I like this game very much and hope that this game will break the record.
I enjoy the style of game this provides by linking visual to problem solving thought.
Horrible clunky controls on more so level 3 couldnt more part broken tutorial
Theres an ad after every single stage. To the point where its unbearable.
It is kind of hard work on level 1. But the other levels are !.... GOOD!!!
This is a really good game just like poly bridges. Nice graphics
Good graphics and physics! Very fun problem solving.
Fun to play. It demands basic physics to imply.
it sucked just go play poly bridges and loading screen ever single time atleast make it fast not like 10 years cop cars and cars to slow van faster then the cop car
I love this game  not one of my favorites but i still love it  im glad the devs made this
Fun game  like the extras each level has that promotes some experimenting.
Im giving it 1 star because every level keep getting harder i cant beat level 22 or 21 or 20 i dont know what each of them im playing soo its really really really really really really really really hard
Very good game with amaging graphics and building skill.It gives a fantastic experience.
Annoying notifications when you dont use it and most of the advertised levels are sneaky 18 DLCs.
I play this game a lot but they should make more easier building controls
I think this a good game I like to try and make briages and this is kinda like Poly Briage.
Please devs remove ads every single time im always seeing ads ill give this five stars if i see improvements.ThankYou
Game is stuck on third bridge  cant move the parts to build the bridge.
Really nice tricky puzzle game. Much more difficult than many games  quite educational
The game has exlent controls.And I love how it is a inspireing game.And latsly I love how it helps children get smarter.
Just ads. Ads when you start. Ads when you lose. Ads when you WIN. This dev sux.
Controls are clunky and offset from where my finger is on the screen. Literally unplayable.
No 189 support. Also the s pen works for every button but you cant use it to build.
I think this game is fun because its exiting seeing if the  vehicle is gonna make it are not!
I like it with all the graphics but it is really really hard tough.
This game made me day. Its funny  happy  and exiting all at once.
Good game  controls are a little wacky.
simple gamplay  enjoyable and use of brain a little while construction
Easy controls. Fun construction concepts.
clean use and interactive levels. just wishing for more levels to play
Too much ads  all the time!! Not playable!
Love the game. I give it a 4 cause it looks blocky and stuff but not harm
its fun I really like gameplay just the ads sometimes ge vin the way still good game )
Youre much better off forking out the 89p for poly bridge than sitting through these numerous and obnoxious adverts that run every. Time. You. Do. Anything.
Thanks for video playback the latest flash player to get the best time to get to get the is required  to the best time
Very good graphics  its very entertaining. AWESOME GAME!!!!!!!
I love this game keep up the great work this game is so fun I have told many people about it now they are playing it ) .
Thiz is a relaxing game to play when u are going to bed or if u want an adventure
A reAlly good game for free. You dont have to have wifi what makes this game great for me. I really recomend it.
Bad game... It takes so lon for me to wait...ive been waiting for the game to load in 3 hours 731 to 1031 
Its fake poly bridge its trash i would rather pay 50 pesos for a good game instead of free for a bad game
Too many ads  the ads pop up everytime a level changes. Boring
It is a well reccomend game just the game you will want for all cool puzzles
Too many ads  enjoyable game
Yer so I just spent 16.00 on this game on a welcome pack and it gave me nothing. I want my money back.
super fun for me. I love building and if u like building then ur going to love this game.
You get what you see in ad and the game is just so oddly addicting
This game is pretty cool but Ill give it a four out of five aint really that cool all you do is just build Bridges I would say its pretty cool I dont like it pretty cool I like it my favorite thing about it is that its just building stuff I like it thats all I need to say Indonesian nnnejfnenn...Full ReviewThis game is pretty cool but Ill give it a four out of five aint really that cool all you do is just build Bridges I would say its pretty cool I dont like it pretty cool I like it my favorite thing about it is that its just building stuff I like it thats all I need to say Indonesian nnnejfnennnndnnfjrnjbtngjnjrbjdbjgthidvhiehfieuot3uoruto3oh3it3jobobnrhnt3oibhnhbhbgvg g gvgvyvygybygyggvgvhtvgyvtycggctfcgcrtctctycfgcgvgghgcghchfhfhgfkgy6tvugvggvhgvgvgggvgvtfyttttyctyfyytfytytfytftthfftftttdGoogle Play Most Innovative Game 2017  Winner        
Basically polybride but low quality and everything is made off jelly like nothing os sturdy still a decent ripoff of the origional
This game is really addicting and it is really fum the only problem is it takes money to build
Great physics puzzle game. Would be good if I could remove Christmas theme.
Its really kind a good but ads play randomly on anytime and thats kind a annoying thing to do you dicks
Realy bad game to befair grafics are bad and could be better its is just a copy of polly bridge
How is this even a game all I see is a picture and I cant even play its like hey guys look at this amazing game build a bridge other guy says all I see is a picture there is no bridges.
This is the first bridge builder game that is free easy to play and really enjoy the game
It was fun but then i got electicuted like sparks every where i couldent move for three and a half weeks it sucked.
Its an AWESOME game if you dont like the adverts then turn you wifi or data off
The controls or whatever are so inconsistent and inaccurate. They just make you mad for this reason.
Its hard to build because theres a limited amount of money so it ticks me off that i cant build what i need to build so i rated one star
perfect game it would be more great if it has microtransiction like upgrade woods road or skills poins etc
I love the game a lot but in my phone it Takes a lot of time to download
Play if u love to see 30 sec ads every 5 min which cannot be skipped
fun and entertaining
Great game and the tutorial isnt even annoying like other games
Good game but you ruined it with full 30 seconds ads every five minutes
Intuitive controls for a bridge building puzzle game.
Its ok I guess but why does the bridge collapse its good because you build it and also its bad because the first part they boss you around
Too many ads! Uninstalling. You should have just priced the app instead of being free but full of afs.
Its good  but these levels get way too difficult way too quickly..
Good game. Had to uninstall due to highly inappropriate ads.
Amazing  I like the fisics and the puzzles
Simple and fun  exactly as advertised!
Looks like a fun game but I cant even load through the tutorial it just freezes
It is fun  original and very entertaining I love this game!!! I see why it has a best game award
Awesome game. Fun  challenging  humourous at times... I love it.
compared to all other bridge builder type games this one dominates. I am fairly impressed considering i am 23 and I assume the target audience for this game is small children haha
This game is absolutely amazing I love the physics and graphics well done Dev.
I love to play this game the only problem is that the cant play protect but it still ok
Doesnt work on bluestacks WHYYYYYYYYYYY (has off border buttons that you need to click to proceed)
Controls are janky. I just dont think this game works on mobile touchscreens.
This game is superb for me the graphics are amazing to super easy to play also
Awesome  just like the game polybirdge but for mobile devices.
I absolutely love it! it is a wonderful game that kind of teaches physics.
It was very diffcult at starting and space and dragon place have to buy
The game is very funni best for kids
This game is very fun and entertaining on long car rides and boring days 100 recommend
Very good practice for a child to learn how to build a bridge found a video on YouTube
This game is good except for almost every time I fail I get a ad
honestly  the game is soooooooo stupid  i mean i dont care what the money cost is  its stupid because i like get this feeling if a game is good or not but this game sucks  like bad bad.
awesome gameplay with amazing graphics and controls.
Isnt this just a copy of poly bridge? The artwork and gameplay is similar in every way
Its awesome and has no adds I mean you GET to build your own brigde and Theres areas you can unlock and much more!
I loved it so much when I grow up I always wanted to be an arcitech or an enginer and I love playing this game because i can practice to be an enginer by playing this game.
Prity impossible to do. Even after getting a hint and building it for me it fails !
its a awesome game the only thing i think its bad about the game is that it is a RIP off of poly bridge
Really good graphics and gameplay. Good bridge sim
Great game they just dont understand that you can use airplane mode to turn off ads your welcome btw
Good game but needs more types of material to build with
Great game you should definitely download it is the best game Ive ever played Im amazed at how much fun they pack into one game
Worth downloading. Not many levels but fun and pretty straight forward
I give this 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 stars because the tutorials never end and it forces you to do things.
Very short game  not enough levels then seriously overpriced.
Very nice game of build bridges
I love it but I whould like to get poly brige blitz plays it and it looks fun.
Complete garbage  if I wanted to watch adds every 4 seconds Id pay for cable tv
this is sooo satisfying but building costs so it does need to be free but satisfying 
kind of good sometime my car falls its still very good thats why i gave it a 4
Mediocre game  ok gameplay  but completly copied from poly bridge how the hell are your asses not thouroughly sued
It is great but I would change the graphics a little bit
Good to play with phones and the sound of the game is really good
This is the BEST game in the world I would rate it five stars if ther isnt any ads
Great fun game and is a really nice game for free and mobile its a really fun and simple game
This game is so much fun creative amazing cool and awesome I highly recommend you to install this fantastic game coz its so much FUN!!!!!
Slow to follow finger  doesnt work with a pen and too many commercials.
Just a worse version of poly bridge and when poly bride is so cheap  just buy that
This game lags and it needs to be able to control the bridge better
This game is so good .when iwas playing this game i se all graphics also good .i am aloso happy to play the game
I love the game  the graphics and quality are great and so is everything else
DONT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME....This is not a game this is app for online television show that shows advertisements every now and then..... i played 10 levela of it and removed it on the spot.... there are many games that are there play store which are much better.....
This so cool and easy
It is a amazing construction game offline.It has many cool levels.
Long unstoppable ads. sucks all thr fun out of the game
Its great game to teach your children how Engineering works. I think they should use this in schools
THIS GAME DOSENT EVEN MAKE SENSE FIX IT YOU NEED TO WATCH A VIDEO TO ENTER LEVEL 2 FIX IT!!!!!!
Good game overall but it is a little complicated
It is a really fun game for killing time and it is educational in science.
I thought at first it was great just like poly bridge was but around level 13 and up the became to techniqal and stuff. If i could give it a 1.5 i would Byee
Something went wrong after the last update? all my previous levels and data deleted and I start from beginning? can fix it?
very most bestest game it is but i can find mistakes in this game but please you make it better
It was like itll be a good time for me to play this game. I played this game last year in 2018.And I just really really liked this game so thats why Installed it.
This is an exeptional game. A little more depth would keep me hooked.
Good game but hard to get 3 stars out of 3 stars.
Fun game but due to the ridiculous amount of adds im uninstalling
fun and well thought out but controls are a bit off
Ive heard about it but it was too laggy for my phone. Its not like im trying to get you guys not to play this great game  but it has a smidge too much content on it.
Well good game but the ads are annoying ]
I like the game its fun but the ads sometimes get repetitive
Great game Im the ads but the creativity is amazing plus its FREE
Too many ads  dont waste your time its unplayable.
I love this game but if it had more money to spend it would be great
I love the experience because it actually shows realistic examples of physics
I love physics apps and this is definitely a good one. In my top 10.
Insane amount of ads and you need to pay for everything.
I wouldnt say its the best game but its fun little challenging and its all in its Goodgame game
Good job for me but ads 10 min. My ads is 10
This game is awesome noice graphics easy controls they are like 4.2  wow!
This is one of the best games Ive ever played please rate it five stars and please like it okay.
Its like poly bridge this game where you need to avoid things or get the car go like i dont know
Game would be fun if there werent forced ads constantly.
its a great game!i think if kids what to be creative they should play this.
When you crash the game 1 time then if you go back it wont start(
Its fun similar to a pc game on steam only I dont have to pay for it.
Simple almost ad free and most ikportly fun!
No stylus support? If ever a game could use stylus support is this one.
Controls are dumb  changing the snapping point randomly
Can add sandbox and unlimited money for sandbox and unbreakable for sand box too
Graphics are great.. gameplay is great. Very fun too.
Fun a little laggy and the 7.99 for what a while new game?!
This game is really fun! some people say that theres crashes but not mine
I like the game it good and can be fun at some times but it can be hard sometimes all in all its a good game
The ads are overly invasive and annoying. Uninstalled
My brain is hurting  to much like school!!! Definitely a recommendation game.. needs government funding 
I love this game but the game sometimes the game laggs so please fix this problem
Decent but Im sorry but its no fun like no hydrolicks and cabel plz add more to the game and it will be five stars
Cool.. But there are so many ads its insane!
Cool you can bild want ever you want really I think this game was easy but its not so far !
This one is excellent.  Very funny  and make my brain working hard.
very good game but some levels are to hard!
The game is just too difficult starting at level 9
we love it  if you build a bad bridge the cars can fall and you can make jumps.
Fun   strats   Challenging   and much more !
the ads are annoying but gameplay is good. i havent plyed polybridge yet
Watching my own bridge collapse is fun.
Its so enertaining
Its pretty cool to be honest just quite a lot of adverts which kinda sucks
Second bridge with firetruck. I built a bridge for exactly 1200 and didnt get the checkmark for building a bridge for 1200 or less.
I like this game because it can basically make you a builder
it has sex ads and now my kids are watching them this is not the kind of game i want them playing?
its cool and fun if you are bord
Great way to kill some time
This is fun if your bored but there is a bit of ads
This is a game you can mess around with the physics and I love that.
its a good game to pass time. just a bit glichy sometimes but that might just be my phone
This is very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very nice game for time pass
it got stuck on the loading screen and the music sucks
Why 1 star first of all the help button it always fail me i thought it will help but i dint even click the help button 1 star!
I  love this game you get to build. And most games u dont even build  and this is my favorite game.
It a good game but every time you close it you will lose your status
On certain phones this game is not compatible so please fix that with the older versions that worked
Very fun and very much a fun difference in all the bridge building games out there
I beat the game 2 times but the under construction area needs to be finished
Yeah  thats totally not a rip of Poly Bridge. Dont encourage that kind of behavior  get the original.
very fun game. just like poly bridge but this ones free
Too many limitations  probably appropriate for 6 to 10 year olds.
Theres not enough levels
You can add like an online building challenge with 15 people at a time and the best one wins?
Poly bridge clone does the worst job to copy it as well
Its really good but ads do suck but but if its fun screw ads 
Pretty good  a few glitches  butnothng they cant fix.
no loading. in my redmi 3s prime smart with 3 GB ram. 1.5 is free.
To many ads  and options to buy.
I love it! kills time while making you use your brain.
Very raw pizza  but great controls  ingenuity  and fun
I love this game a lot but I wish there was a sandbox mode
Level is hard to clear and does nt make sense
This id really beter then poly bridge  and this is free!!
I dont like this game because I try 10 to 20 but bridge not build
Honestly i think level 15 is rigged plus when i tryed to get a hint it said sorry no ads avlable  SO ANNOYOING
This is a great game but there are a ton of ads but I suggest you download it 
Perfect game for all. Very fun and the levels is hard please make it easy please 
Nice game that makes you think  without to many ads.
Its a basic version to the original poly bringe but its still fun
there is no stop button
game is suspicious . it randomly starts bluetooth wifi turns on location without permission . stay away from this app guys .
I havent downloaded it but  just by the screenshots and icon  I can tell it is an exact copy of Poly Bridge.
Game is overall really good although its quite easy to complete and I would really like more updates for levels
Amazing game for builders .children of any age can play
Build a bridge vs poly bidge it the same but the ploy bridge is better I dont know why
Really fun game great in game physics. Definitely makes time go by!
Good Game But A bit laggy I like that it is 3d as well
Uses too much data for no specific reason. Even after the game is loaded.
all I have to say is good game of you give it a little more twikes here and there Im shore it will be perfect and a lot of people would like to play It  but Im other words its just areally nice game
This game show very well what it look like it help you learn how to use it
A really good game for you that is looking for a Polly bridge type game.
it good but it would be easyer using a keyboard and mouse
sooooooo annoying if you are trying to do all the challenges. cant even doit all on the first level.
Worst game of the world its only have 11 level other levels is locked please dont install your network only waste
Its the best bridge builder game Ive ever played. And YOU CAN JUMP
Great game but need to work on the graphics
Lol I love how in editors choice  for people who like physics  or to watch things collapse....
This game makes you use your brain. Love this.....
good but too much tutorial stuff
Its good but It needs some work done on it I do recommend this game
I mostly like the game except the music. Hope you remove any type of music.
Really fun! failing is just as good as passing
I love this game. The ambient noise is perfect.
Trash ad after every 2 seconds
After a couple of levels it get super hard  and borderline impossible.
so far this game is very awesome... it is definitely the better of the road construction games Ive played
The ads are so long that the game is un playable
I am recording this game for my YouTube Channel and I love the art style of this game. Very good game. 1010 100100
The game is ok but not crazy about the delayed reaction construction control.
After 5 minutes of play? Seems cool so far. Would be a good tool for first year engineeringphysics.
Its not poly bridge but its closer than bridge constructor and is pretty fun
Okay this one  i have to recommend the may not be that tempting at first  but when you finally get to play it  oh DAMn its fun!!
its a very good game and graphics but its too damn hard
On pc its called   Poly Bridge and it cost 5 o steam but this is like beta version
Fun  mercifully light with the microtransactions.
Its great but its hard but fun really fun!! And kinda easy.
Omg the vibration for the push notification is so strong. Fix this
Too many tutorials. And constant advertising
i love thus game alot!!! it lets me spread my creativity out every were  and lets my mind wounder. its a great game. please make more! if u get this app u would love it!
Its cool the graphics is ok and very addicting game its fun too
it is hard but it is fun because you can find diffrint ways to bild a berij
Con. Spent coins to build the bridge for me  it collapsed so wasted my coins. Sort this out.
I love this game becase I like bilding
ist a good game yes.but I think you could decrease the amount of materials
It is quite decent. It can be difficult(obv) but a very good game good job
I have already played this game on PC and is incredibly. I couldnt lose the opportunity of play it on Android
this game is great but i wish it had were u could conrtol the throttle and brake
Cant play without watching ads
I download but i can play a offline only i finish and i spin i got a jackpot now all of the money was unlimited
This game is really fun and I not finish all the levels yet books level 6 is hard
Play for a minute  watch annoying advertisements for a minute...
Awsome you must play it but it has ads not tons but a fair amount 
I love this game so much but i remind me about poly bridge
cant play it im stuck in a view of an island with a light house and a house and trees
fun fun FUN FUN fun fun FuN and then no more levels you gotta get out your wallet and send em cash i guess they dont make enough off of advertisers go figure
drains battery power way too fast  but its still a great app
This is one of those must have games  its the best you are not wasting your time with this game )
Fun and awesome physics. Really gives your brain a sweat
Since when does a bridge have anything to do with jumps  distance and flips. Call it something else
Okay game  but too many annoying ads.
Game is nice but Too much advertising during gameplay
Amazing and really fun to play I would recommend it to everyone 5 stars
horable  the game tells you what to do and if you do anything different it does not work
It is a good game and controls the best will you add more updates
Good game but feels like a nock off of poly bridge
Lot of pay to win. Good job its not multiplayer
sometime it works sometime it doesnt at least its a poor persons choice of poly bridge
This game is like teaching your self how to build sturdey buildings and stuff so thats why I rated 4 stars.
This game is stupid I dont like games that pop up ads and dont sound stupid but Im sorry
Camera angle is so bad if there is a update please tell me because i do not like the camera angle
The hint builds a bridge that fails every time. Level 15. Stupid.
When Is sound off you still can hear when you go to another level.
