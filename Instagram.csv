Ill be reading a text post but because theres a video below it that barely peeks into the screen  the screen dips upwards. The second that (usually an ad) video finishes  the feed jumps up  making me lose my place in what I was reading or scrolling through. I also dont like that it auto centers the post  which is why these ad vids get to peek in.Bringing you closer to the people and things you love.  Instagram from Facebook

I contacted support and they asked me to make a photo of myself with the number on a paper they send to me. I made a photo and sent them.

After my reels suddenly gone  I tried to uninstall the app but turns out the interface back to the old version of Instagram where no reels  and no music feature in story. Please fix the problem!Bringing you closer to the people and things you love.  Instagram from Facebook      
The algorithm is annoying  I have no idea why I see so much of done accounts and so little of others.

Still garbage Fascist Facebook in disguise. Garbage needs to force quit once in a while. I can upload to other sites in seconds  but not this. It sometimes takes hours to say it failed to upload.

Instagram is just full of bugs. I have various accounts  and the one account I have for business  doesnt have access to 1 minute reels.

Use this app constantly. So I noticed the little stupid changes. You cant share photos to your story without clicking through multiple buttons in the create section.

I have written my complaint but didnt get any response yet. I dont know what type of hashtags should I use I have used each and every technique of using hashtags. I did a lot of research and implemented all the things but it doesnt care for creators. In official instagram video they say to use 23 hashtags and after using it becomes hard to get 5 likes.

I never actually see posts from people I follow. Drafts get deleted. Videos disappear when getting posted and cannot be found. Colors randomly switch between dark and light mode making text white on white. Its just been a mess lately which is really sad. Also not enjoying the video push on a photo sharing app. Reels dont work wellBringing you closer to the people and things you love.  Instagram from Facebook

During a call the app can be closed to save battery life  which is one positive feature. Also  when looking through posts  one must be fast to save those of interest because as soon as new posts have been uploaded the image being viewed will disappear as it is bumped out of queue.Bringing you closer to the people and things you love.

I decided to just delete my whole account because of the headaches that the app has caused from too much time spent looking at my phone screen. The text would remain white as the app switched from dark to light so I would have to close the app and restart it each time.
