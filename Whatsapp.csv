I have had a really good experience with whats app. Want more animal emojis to be added. So many are missing
The camera bug that everyone talking about. The fix is to actually change your phone screen display resolution (Samsung S20) to FHD or WQHD. Avoid HD for now untuk Whatsapp fix it

I am using it for a lot of year but now a days its taking a lot of time and mbs in everything an it also dont show call and message of anyone when I open the app then it show everything Please fix this problem or a solution
Whenever I open my whatsapp it takes too long to get to the chatting screen. My device android version is 11 so I think thats the problem maybe
Its ridiculous. I think so its time to move to anyother app cause there are too many bugs and they are jot able to fix it.
This app is absolutely fine......only problem is the script which becomes visible after deleting the messages.
What is going on with the camera that it is alwaysin the zoom mode. I am very unhappy about this I have even uninstalled the app and reinstalled it again. Doesnt help at all
When i recieve others status nd want to put on my status direct from that persons chat box there would no option for msg writing on wp status so that is my bad experience with it apart from this ....this app is useful
The archive feature is now a problem it should be at the bottom of all my chats after I archive some chats instead of being at the top.
After the latest update I didnt get a chance to scan the qr code to login watapps desktop by using dual apps Coz its pop out from the screen. Pls fix it ASAP!!!
Like everyone else the WhatsApp camera seems to be zoomed in automatically after the new update and its really confusing. I had to use my normal camera and send the pictures from my gallery
I love it it was really really usefull to make online homeworks!!!!I love this app soooooo much!!!!!I will give 5 star becausei can video call with my friends and chat!!!!And this app are very very usefull to make online class!!!
It should features such as saving saving in bulit whstapp itself.... Increase forward limit. Increase image resolution while sharing and increase video forward limit from 64 mb to minimum 500 mb.. And theme customizations..
I have ir for a cuple years now and its great. But the only problem is when i forward a photo or a video the text that was sent with it doesnt get forwarded. That whould be great if it was added.
Recent updates has lot of issues such as image documents are not being shared and also not being saved. Whatsapp camera is also not saving images. Pls release stable version asap...
Only use this because one friend has it. Works but annoying you have to keep phone on to use web whatsapp. Slow to open. Facebook

In group and broadcast messaging our sent messages seen in 3 different ways message info. 1. Seen by. 2. Delivered to. 3. Remaining. But problem is that who remaining is not seen anywhere. Solve this.
This app lets you communicate with your friends and family members if there from out of the country. Or in the military service I enjoy this app with my peacekeepers that are friends. I love the app it keeps your conversation private and phone calls also. I recommend this app to friends.

Hi I am facing problem while using this latest version of whatsapp. The issue is
I cant see the statuses and it says must download when I do it says must try later its been happening for days and if anyone sends me a photo or video they arent opening
In the next update if you can provide the number of status views next to My status will help in knowing instead of opening the status and checking who viewed
I have a problem in this app when i uploaded any status there is an error occur nd which i received recordings videos and pictures also not loaded why it there is a problem??
Notification wont pop up till you open the app. Such a waste. Sometime it wont make sound and sometime it will show you offline although youre online.
Amazing I can connect from my Mac and IPhone at the same time .it is compatible with No laptops and many MORE !!! I really recomend
This times there is a problem with downloading and uploading of pictures audio and status
Why is the archive right at the top??... Pls put it back to the bottom to where it was initially... The whole purpose of an archived chat is lost with this new update!!!!!
My camera is zoomed in when I try and take photos directly from the app. Online it notes that this is a Beta issue... I am NOT a beta tester! Dont roll out your kk that i dont want!
Smart phone I have this app already in my android device
I always have problems with this app noises in the background. Its as though I have a third person on here. Your app is not as secure as you claim.
Suggestions add a scanner or scanning option inside watsaap inside the pinning option . This will make more convenient for document sender and many other peoples
i like the app but the updated version is very slow i cant send a voice note
I hate the fact that in order to use the app Im force to keep it updated but since I did I cannot sent messages with the paperplane icon. Fix the bugg
I am facing issues while sharing images from Facebook as the file format is not supported However when the same file is saved and shared from gallery I am able to share it.
the status video limit is 30secs. so if i post a long video and i have to divide it to two statuses the video
It is very nice app and also very helpful i am very happy to use this app because in lockdown i cant meet my friends but fot this app i can talk to my friends whole day.
After I updated WhatsApp camera is not working properly...... There is a bug in camera ..... We cant zoom in from 1 ..... It is stuck in 1 only
New update camera is zoomed in makes it very hard to take snap shots
Since the last update its disappointing me a lot the camera got automatically zoomed 8 but the image is only of 1 zoom
Great for communication pleases add an everyone option for group chats
New updation about archive chat is worse. I want my archive chat to be hidden at the bottom of all chats or password protected. Im giving this new update zero star
I noticed lately that theres a problem with the camera. The zoom in is always activated by default. Could you please fix this bug?
Never had any issue except all of a sudden when I take a picture it captures the imagine off shot
The app is very easy to use. But I think a Schedule send feature should be added in it. Best app for hang out with friends. Thanks.
It was beautiful app till last night but now Im trying to open my whats app account its continuously forces me to reinstall it but when I try to re install it shows same error again and again
Suddenly my WhatsApp notifications does not appear as pop up and I dont get call notifications its creating an issue for me please get it fixed.
Awesome but new feature is not good . Can see once n then delete . Record should be there for long time
With the latest update the in built camera is super zoomed in. I am an android user. Please fix this asap. It is very inconvenient.
Recently there is a glitch going on where I cant zoom out in camera and it is always zoomed in Im trying reinstalling WhatsApp
