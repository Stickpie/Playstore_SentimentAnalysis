Font Keyboard
The fonts are pretty good but the app does not have auto correct so it makes me type slower.

Nice app..... it contains many different types of fonts and also different types of emojis. The most important thing is that we can use this keyboard in any app. There are many more reasons that I like this such as smooth typing no bugs problem easy to use and much more
Love this app completely free pretty straightforward very fun and easy to use. Would love for it to have auto correct but I can get over that it would also come 8n handy if it had other language options so I could use this when speaking French. Auto correct and different languages are kinda hard...Full ReviewLove this app completely free pretty straightforward very fun and easy to use. Would love for it to have auto correct but I can get over that
I personally love this app! You can choose from many different fonts which is helpful and cool. Although when you type even without a font it doesnt autocorrect. Id love to see if there will be a future update WITH autocorrect. Thank you. 3
I rarely give full five stars to an app unless the app is good this is a perfect example first of all its free yeah I know alot of the other apps are free but damn ngl this is the experience for an app that would usually cost money but for free. Secondly its very diverse and isnt just font...Full ReviewI rarely give full five stars to an app unless the app is good
Thank you so much for making this app. I love this app! it is so great but it glitches out my keyboard. Maybe you should add auto correct or whatever it is called. But overall I really like this app at the end of the day!
Okay so I recently reviewed this app. This app is really good it has a good amount of fonts and emojis. I have some feedback can you add more fonts? The fonts that are previded are good But I think u could add more fonts. Very good app 10010.
Absolutely love this Keyboard! It has everything except for things like text prediction or Capitolization. Things of that nature. Which is the sole reason that I did NOT want to rate this app! Now with that being said with those exceptions I am a yes across the board! I love the cute fonts!
Its really good but when I try to change my keyboard (I usually hold the space bar and world icon) but it doesnt let me switch keyboards! Instead I have to go to settings and use 3 minutes of my time to switch keyboards. Please FIX this.
I love the app it is stupendous and I love all the different type of fonts and it is so cool to use in some of the apps. But one tiny problem and that tiny problem is that I would have to update it very often to use different fonts and It would make my keyboard glitch and so on but other than that...Full ReviewI love the app it is stupendous and I love all the different type of fonts and it is so cool to use in some of the apps. But one tiny problem and that tiny problem is that I would have to update it very often to use different fonts and It would make my keyboard glitch and so on but other than that I give this app a 5star rating
its pretty good even though it doesnt have auto correct I suggest adding the ender font since Ive seen a lot of people using an online translator and adding it would be much easier to use
This is one of the most straightforward and easy to use keyboard apps. There are several different types of emojis and fonts that you can use. Forgot to mention that this app would be much better and quicker to use if it had autotypingautocorrect.
This app is very fun! I can do several fonts! The only thing I hope maybe you can try to do something about the auto correction but I can deal with thats in no problem! Other then that its a wonderful app and I really enjoy it!
its cool but for a 5 rating from me the keyboard should be able to do what our usual and normal keyboards do which is the option for predictive text and oh yes it would be extra cool if the fonts of this keyboard would work with everything else other than whatsapp and soforth so thats why Im ...Full Reviewits cool but for a 5 rating from me the keyboard should be able to do what our usual and normal keyboards do which is the option for predictive text and oh yes it would be extra cool if the fonts of this keyboard would work with everything else other than whatsapp and soforth so thats why Im only rating it a 2.....!
This app is AMAZING! I had another fonts app on my tablet it wasnt that good because i had to go to my other keyboard to send it but now im happy that this app exists. Please make more apps because this one is amazing!
Decent app. Doesnt have a great menu though. Needs a few functions like numbers at the top auto punctuate auto correct and then it would be the best app. The fonts are great. It says in app purchases but I dont see anything to purchase?
its Really usefull App..It has more types of font styles Really helps in using But what a small problem when typing ...words have to come automatically on top of the keyboard ..so that we can correct the mistakes... Thank you
font is nice but there are some stuff missing from it. I used another font keyboard and it had the same font but it had the things that are missing. The only way i had access to that symbol was copy and paste. Please add more fonts it would make it more enjoyable
Its a great app so i never had to go to the internet and constantly look up things i need but the only problems is when it bugs out and says it cant be used at that time? Its only happened a few times and doesnt really bug me but overall a good app!
The fonts are cool I wish some kind of keyboard theme added or at least solid colours that I can choose because its just the normal and boring keyboard except it has fonts. I have no complaints about this app its a good app and Im so glad it isnt a scam
It has several kinds of fonts that are really good to choose from !! Dont worry if u want to use your GBOARD again . If you will long tap on the language settings you can change your keyboard again . And also Please provide Auto correct system too !! )
I always use this app the best app I ever had. But I only rate it 4 star because the very important part of a keyboard doesnt have this app that is the AUTO CORRECTION. If the developer would add auto correction Id be happy to give this app 5 star.
I only use this whenever I want to exaggerate a word when typing so autocorrect isnt a problem for me. This is a regular app and though handy one to have. Five stars because I have no problems with it.
It is a very good app i enjoyed writing with different styles however the app must have auto correction and for free words pop up. I love it.
I really like the app its free plus the fonts is just amazing! The only thing that bother me is that it doesnt have auto correct if that was included I will give give it 100 a five star review `

And plz add the spell suggestions it makes typing easyy
I have never gotten an add here because I dont use it often the fonts are nice and I totally recommend no auto correct but who cares also if I remember there are animals and stars and stuff like that you can use
I like the sound on the keypad touch.......and the fonts are really incredible.......i have download all the apps font.....but this app are amazing.....it really cool rather than other apps
Love the app super easy to use espically when my friends ask me how i acttualy use fonts and i can easily send the link without struggling to memorize it so yeah overall great app and the best fonts app I ever had
I love this app so much it has great emojis and great fonts its also super easy to access I just think that it should have an auto correct system then I would immediately change my review to 5!
I like this app very much but maybe add searching in the emojis? Because i have a hard time finding the emojis i need and i think i cant correct the spelling because i also have a hard time in spelling please add this its okay of you dont.
Its amazing. Its good for font typing decorating profiles being aesthetic etc. Overall its just great. 2 on my font list.
Nice app loving it each day.. I did recommend it to friends too they really appreciate using it and they never stop thanking me for it. A truly nice app the best Ive used for a while.
Wish this keyboard has Auto Corrections and corrections of words on the top of a keyboard but best fonts app I cannot believe this app gives so many free fonts no kinds of purchases and I am so happy!
The app is overall pretty good but I wish it had more fonts and some fonts dont have all the letters for example one of the s doesnt have the letter H
I love having the option to write incursive or gothic. Theres so any different fonts to choose from. Definitely one of my favorite apps.
I am giving it a 4 star because it doesnt have an option to show suggestion words. But the options of the fonts are really awesome.
This app is really good and has a variety of different styles of typing. Love it. This app is a 5 star worth.
The symbols are so cute and there are so many different fonts. It is good for people like me who type very slowly because the keyboard is bigger than the normal keyboard.
This is a great app and I really love it Im giving it 4 stars is because I dont really remember how to spell long words so if you could add autocorrection that would be awesome and great you I find really great fonts to use so if you add more fonts that would be great I really love the fonts there...Full ReviewThis is a great app and I really love it Im giving it 4 stars is because I dont really remember how to spell long words so if you could add autocorrection that would be awesome and great you I find really great fonts to use so if you add more fonts that would be great I really love the fonts there is so many fonts to use!
bug hi i really like this app but i think there is a bug when i open my youtube and edit my youtube description its not working like keep back by itsself ? its weird and i really need it for my videos so please fix this thank yu
This is so nice!.. And it finally is better i just have one conplaint Its doesnt have a thing like you cant see the top or Iike words at the top
Its really cool cause its got a typewriter outline serif small caps comic like really lot of stuff i really like it but of someone using this app so they can see it as i say it is free u should try it out its really fun u can chage any type writer
if you are scared that this keyboard spies that thing that it says this keyboard mihht collect data says it in all ksyboards. Still i reccomend using this only fod fonts cuz it might collect data. I reccomend gboard and swiftkey if you are looking for a safe keyboard. But no fonts there.
Really like the app. Has different styles and really cute emoji. Im enjoying the app very much and so glad its free !
Pretty cool. Love the symbols too but slightly shocked by the genitalia. Please consider adding the fonts called RITZ and Bauhaus I was hoping to find them. Thanks. Needs more settings I hate the auto cap that needs turning off.
I love this so much its amazing i really like this but my sister sayed me one time when it will get old so it donot work care fully so i geted worred that what will happen because i donot used it so much so i donot know but kebord words been type very quickly so that it would be bad also thats y i d...Full ReviewI love this so much its amazing i really like this but my sister sayed me one time when it will get old so it donot work care fully so i geted worred that what will happen because i donot used it so much so i donot know but kebord words been type very quickly so that it would be bad also thats y i donot gived one like
This is a very nice app it have many fonts but the problem that there should be spell suggestion and also we should be able to change the theme there is only black and white but overall the app is amazing.
There are so many fonts to choose from! But to every great story there is always a downfall you have to pay for the wallpapers and some of the fonts bemcome locked and you cant us them
This app is very good i love it but please add persian too not any font for it just add its normal font because i need to switch between my keyboards
Love it. I use it all the time!has all the fonts youd ever need. I reccomend this definitely!
Its a pretty good app I just wish that it had autocorrect. But I just downloaded a few days ago so I dont know if it does and if it did I couldnt find how to turn it on
Love The Keyboard But a Little Problem It Doesnt Work On Other apps But Really Nice Keyboard ) Really Love this It helps My texts To make Aesthetic (in your option) Really Love this App Sometimes i dont understand but Great app
lots of fun. I using all the different fonts. A couple letters should be fixed to match the font theyre in
Its great app I love using this plus this have many cool fonts aswell only thing which bother me is they should have autocorrect in the key board overall its perfect app
I really like this app. Its really fun and its good when you want to write someones name in a funny or cute or really special name
Its cool but the only think I dont like is that there is no auto correct and it gets annoying when you have such a small keyboards like phones
The keyboard I used earlier has clipboard. Which hekped me to store my clips forever. This keyboard doesnt have clipboard. Add this item then i will give it 5 stars.

My phone is Alcatel U5 (4047G) with Android Nougat 7.0
This app is great but i would love it if you guys add in this emoji i made it myself so it would be awesome if you could add this but decided that this app is great its easy to use and theres lots of fonts and emojis
I just like the app its wonderful and the best thing is u can change the board by just a click but it should have more type of writing but rest of all it is just amazing
Really good app ngl but no auto correct and lack of other language support really downgrade the experience omitting those aspects really good app
All of the fonts a beautifully made and I never have a problem using it except when putting my password in.
This app is really amazing I love it.there are no ads and its totally free. And there are many keybord styles
Its a very good app but I give it four star because its not got auto correct it makes me mess up with spelling but this is the only font app with emojis that I could find
Its a really good apps but the reason i rate 3 stars because why i dint have small number..... my friend have it but i dint.... it show me x thing yeah that thing
Amazing app with so many free fonts the app doesnt take so much space on your phone either.
I didnt expect this keyboard is like this...it was better than what i was expecting...there are so many pretty font and other people can also see the fonts that youre using....5 star...

its easy to use and LOVE rhis app. It doesnt have a few emojis a normal keyboard has but thats okay with me.
It has no stylish font. Just have some silly ones. So it is not so good.
I love the app but its just that everytime i played my roblox and type with normal letters..it always flashes like what happend? But still love this app ^^
It works so well!!Its very helpful to android phones!The creator must be very fashionable and creative
Its just soo fun....I like all the different features they are all free and its fun!! 5 star
Its a amazing app but in the free fire the other handwriting is not using only normal handwriting would be use
Pls add more languages in english so hard to type the enter arrow is not functioning in msgr. Please improve asap.
Its good at fonts and typing but when its in games you cant see what youre typing cause its blocked by the keyboard
Its good but i think auto correct translator and copy and paste board should be added
Soooooo Amazing!!! Fonts are very cool! The other fonts is can be prankster! Roarr!
I really like these etc. And the keyboard is really easy to use!
Different types of fonts...I love this app and is very comfortable to use.
Its so cute and u dont even need a wifi or data to have the font like this ( ) .and u can just go back to normal if u want.
Its amazing you can pick so many diffrent fonts and even little cute animalsdesigns
super helpful but wish there was a vibrate feature and a auto correct when typing on the normal font
would love more fonts and updates in the future! Overall the app is great and it easy to use
Beautiful! It makes my messages more pleasant to read and it is easy to use. Peace
the best font app actually theres no add you can turn off the fonts so thats cool!
Its a great app though it would be great if there was an autocorrect option for faster typing.
I love it so much it works so well. Ive had no problems for the long while ive used tjis app. Ofcourse I reccomend it!
Its a great app but it doesnt let me change the theme rather than light or dark and i would need auto correct

Its pretty good but doesnt have auto correct option.... So 4 stars...
Its a great app after all but i would appriciate if you add auto correct it would be easier `
Simple but effective and a massive help for roleplayers like me
How many people have to complain about auto correction before you add auto correction? You would think this would be the top priority. So for this reason alone you shall get 1 star.

Such a good app. There was another app I had just like this. It told me I needed to watch an ad to unlock the font for 30 days. As soon as I heard about fonts I downloaded it. Fortunately no ads to watch AT ALL. Not even any bugs or glitches. Really satisfied with it. Keep up.

I know by myself that that this app is good. But the thing is that they dont have autocorrection. Because in fact Ive saw a lot of people seemed think the same. And also i think theres something off about the normal font. I dont know what but i think so. But the app is amazing )

Had no problems at all. I would just recommend more different fonts instead of lots of versions of the same one. E.g. there are three types of the font Serif and they are all very alike. There are also four types of Sans and the font is pretty boring. Thats all. Its amazing fir being free would definetly recommend.
Its lagging and its hard to type but its good.

I loved using this app its simple straight forward and has some great fonts. There is some ones that I wouldnt use though and some which have a couple versions of themselves that all look alike such as serif and sans.

This app is really good! All the fonts are awesome and stuff but sometimes some of the letters on the keyboard merge for me. Anyone else? Still I think its brilliant other then that!!! Would recommend!

Overall I think I may not use this app without the changes Id need to use it comfortably

This app is actually good there are enough fonts and some of those dont work on all apps (no problem). But this doesnt has autocorrect which makes a lot of typing mistakes...

This app collects data on your network activity what words you type and the words youve previously used on your keyboard before. Cant say Im a fan of this privacy breach.

I using all the different and you can also switch between the fonts keyboard or you original one which is a really nice feature to have! 55 definitely recommend
Its very fun to use and the fonts are cool. Two things 1. You have to switch to the number section unlike where you can just hold some of the keys to get numbers. 2. Autcorrect doesnt work which in some cases is helpful but most of the time it is a bit annoying. Overall a good and useful app
I love this app but when I wanna go back to my normal keyboard my keyboard doesnt pop up so I usually have to uninstall then reinstall if I want to switch. Please fix this problem. EDIT They fixed it so my review is now 5 stars. It works really good and has tons of choices!

It would be nice if auto correction can be added in the feature and in that fact said I always auto correct but anyways 2. It would be nice if there would be more cooler or better fonts if possible themes on keyboard and maybe sound in typing.but this is the best app!Express yourself the way you want
Great app! I could use different kinds of fonts i really love the designs! 5 star app! The keyboard is a little too small by i reccomend it to other users who needs fonts! I really love this app it helps me so much! Thank you!
I am very impressed by this app it has many fonts symbols and maybe more in the future! BUT the thing that I like about it that its different from other apps that you need to pay to use or not complete if you dont pay but this app is Free.
AMAZING APP! I have been using this app for monthd now! I dont recommend using it as your daily keyboard for typing I personally use it to when I want to change my font to something unique to be more expressive! Nevertheless its a great app and I dont remember getting any ads from it!
Cool app!! Nothing wrong with it for me

I have found a way to change the top of the keyboard back and get it out again if you have a samsung. At thw bottom you have a directions pad go all the wsy to the right and u see a little keyboard icon press that and press fonts to turn the font app on and to turn it off
I really like this app and I like the fonts. Its easy to use and you have a fair variety of fonts to choose from But one thing I dislike is that it doesnt work on punctuation marks. It might only be me so Ima just say that this app is really worth trying^^)b

The app is so easy to use its free and its really fun to use the little emojis and fun fonts. I really enjoy this app and hope you do too. I spent a long time looking for good font keyboards and my search ended here when I was recommended this app its so amazing!
ADD NEW FONTS!!1!1!!11!! also this app is great
Really great app. I am love it.

4 because you have to press the button under the delete button to saend and it gets a anoying
Its super nice and easy to use. Not very hard to understand and have complicated settings. Every fonts are free and available. You can easily change to this font keyboard to your usual setting.
Great App! Very useful app! Tons of fonts and cute symbolsemojis. Very easy to use and so simple! I recommend to download it 33 I tried many dont apps.. But its not great like this one! 5 stars for this app! Them Ive been looking for this 3333

Theres cool fonts and stuff but I have a few problems. 1 theres not many fonts and most other font apps have them. 2. The numbers dont match the font. If u fix it it will be 5 starts but its a 3 star for me.
This font keyboard is just very fun and super easy to use with the font bar directly above the keyboard you can change fonts in a jiff. However I personally would really like more cursive fonts etc... and this has literally 0 ads btw its amazing
fonts is an amzing app it was so easy to set up and i absolutely LOVE the fonts it comes with. It isnt glitchy and you dont have to do any copy and pastes at all. it an awesome app . 5 Stars would reccomend
Beautful fonts never seen others like it
Fonts is such a great app and easy to work two you can have all different types of fonts but there is one problem i would prefer if when you go on to a font that the numbers are also on that font instead of the normal font but other than that it is a great app
this is cool but theres no autocorrct and its hard to type (im usng it now its rally hard bcaus thd keyboard is small) I just switched back to my normal one and its much easier to use. This app is good for fonts and emojis though. I just ask for a bigger keyboard.
This is amazing it was an amazing experience and i definitely recommend for someone who is writing on wattpad. Im one of those people who write on wattpad and this definitely helps the readers stay hooked! Download!
The fonts are amazing and they cute symbols and everything. But unfortunately on some apps(especially discord) I cannot separate paragraphs apart as the button only sends the writingtext. I love this app pretty much its just that Issue that has been bothering me.
The app was amazing and worked perfectly however now when i start typing the keyboard doesnt only type the first letter with capslock but the first 34 which is really annoying and the only hing i can do is just type a letter and then wait 12 seconds for the caps lock to deactivate by itself.
Its a good app but most of the fonts you just wouldnt use. For example theres a font with smiley faces and a font thats upside down. I also wish they added more simple fonts maybe Fujiyama or a pixelated font.
Its an amazing app but why I rated it 4 stars is because its hard to use and I also wish in the future there would be an auto correct because sometimes I forget how to spell things. Overall its a great app.

Well I havent used it yet cause I just downloaded it but if I want to enable it it says something like are you sure ypu want to enable fonts?fonts can collect the stuff you write encluding personal Data Like Passwords and Credit card Passwords or something...
I like the app but it is hard for me to get into because I have a chromebook and it will not let me get in because settings is not letting me enable fonts. I have got into it but then I had to uninstall it. I dont remember how to get back in. Overall this is a great app.
This app is very very good. It makes me happy and i use to this app for tiktok but i can not change language and it is bad because i need arabic language.so okay
This app is amazing there diffrent emojis and fonts and it is just so amazing and swesome i defintly recomend downloading it. It have so many cool things about it and if it does like it does on my phone youcan change keyboards with out going on the app. You should absolutley download it. I love it
its perfect to use in facebook to make your post stand out only thing I wish is that it had autocorrect capibilites but its still awesome all the symbols and everything too! its the best one for free I tried a bunch!
It gave me a notification saying that the app is going to cost money or its going to make you have to do a subscription the notification also said that they will block your keyboard with the notification giving you only the option of rating this....great keyboardapp.

I love this app so much but whenever I try and erase it will have a ? At the end! But I highly recommend it but sometimes people will be rude to me... But I still recommend you shouldnt care what others say have a good day goodbye!
I have had this app for a year and I love it! No problems no bugs AND no vibrating! I recommend this app. 5 stars. If there was an option for more stars I would give the highest rating.
I love it a lot! Ive been typing it so much! But the only problem is that there is a limit language. It doesent even have Greek but I dont mind. Keep up the good work )
its great its simple and it works
Its vry nice i was finding this from 2 months and finally i found.. thanks so much
I love this app so much. I suggest that you should put autocorrect because sometimes I made mistake in typing and I type fast. Overall I love it 33
Amazing app but needs a bit of upgrading

So many cool fonts to use! But on my last phone it would not let me download this app.. I got so mad because i could not use this to have fonts but this app is super cool in general!
This app is incredibly easy and has alot of fonts. I would definitely recommend it ) But I would like it if there would be more emojis for example like the little gun Thingy. Other than that its a great app.
Very simple easy and beatiful when used. I commend the developer for a job well done and recommend that more beautiful fonts be added to spice up experience.
Its works really good for me. I have no problems with the app. So far so good. I love it. It Has Cool Fonts Like The One. I just love everthing about it.
This is a super great app! Only problem is that it doesnt really work on certain apps that I use all the time. But otherwise no complaints from me!
Realy nice app have some awsome fonts which i like ... sometimes it cant manage to write in Block laters. You should me carefull of that.. The main this is it wont show you the correct word if you type it wrong. Actully it depends on the user... I like that way but some dont.. Thank you
Overall pretty good but does it really need our passwords and credit card pins?
I love this app I can use all different fonts! But I really wish that there were more symbols and fonts but overall Its very amazing!
this app is great! Its my goto when i need fonts! But if you can add a bit more fonts and symbols and can you please fix that it can take everything i type? Thank you!
Hello ! I love this app so much but I have a little thing to say . My friend has this app like me but she has more fonts than me . Can you solve the problem because i want all the fonts . Thanks !
amazing fonts and very good emojis 1010
Love the app the only thing I dont like is that sometimes when Im typing the keybored just goes down and I cant type and then a few seconds later they come back up. Other then that its great!
Sometimes depending on the font it would have a red underline even when the word was spelled correctly. Otherwise overall I would totally reccomend using it.
I rate this app 5 stars! It is amazing and it is very useful as a fan page and there are many different fonts to use! If you are going to choose a font app choose this one)
it was fine but they are some things that i think this all needs it needs the height to be a little smaller and i think personally i would like it if we could design our keyboard but over all its good
Definetely a great app! does not contain adds straight foward makes everything easier over a hundred of my friends have downloaded this amazing app! i just wanna ask if you could also put spelling check in it please that would be aswesone!....Overall Great Font App i totally recommend it!Express yourself the way you want
I love this app! Its not glitchy like most of them I have ever downloaded. The only negive comment and the reason its 4 stars instead of 5 is it can be difficult to read certain fonts on here.
i think the app overall is good but the only broblem is that on the top of the key board there is no sugestion for words or a microphone to voice type but everything else is fine.
I think its a great app however thr keybar is smaller so I make mistakes really easily and i dont have autocorrect or a suggestion bar so its hard to type things out without making mistakes and going back to fix them takes up time overall a great app.
I really like this app. Especially the emojiees l hope that move font will be awailble. Something they need to update the app.
My sister downloaded a different one but I think this one is better Ill change my review if I is slightly better
This App is the best I cant stoo using it Its rare for me to find apps like this So for anyone whos trying to find a font aop Id definitely recommend this to them
Its super easy to use! Even when your offline its amazing! I love it so much to all writers or rpiers you must download this!!!
Best app in less storage I just loved it so much It has a lot of symbols and so many of beautiful text Just go for it
Absolutely amazing. I love the fact that its easy to use and has amazing too!! I live the emojis in here as well their adorable. I recommend downloading this app right now!!`( ^^
I do really love this app especially surprising my friends with it the fonts . Emojis . Everything is amazing in it like it gives a great experience for the phone it self

The option to switch to font keyboard doesnt show in the main normal keyboard screen if not it is a good app with variable designs of fonts and emojis
I love this app it has very beautiful fonts the problem is when searching on places like google it doesnt have the search button and I have to switch back to my normal keyboard

A great app really exceeded my expectations I really love the fonts and emojis but can you please add a word suggestion strip function would be really helpful enjoying it very much. Hope you would notice this and work on it .
Great keyboard app but the only problem is that no auto correct my nephew was trying to type something like follow but he said fllow. But other than that nothing is really wrong.
This app is amazing! So many pretty fonts my personal fav is serif. The only thing that they could inprove is makeing the premium more affordable or free. Overall i fully recormend this app )

This is a very good app and it works very well plus i use it ALOT I recommend it! And one of the best things is that I can delete some of the characters? (Idk what their called) and I can make faces like this ( ) I love this app!
I love this app. Its so usefull and fun. You dont need to pay and there are no ads or whatever. 5 stars.
Its nice! Love all the fonts! But theirs one thing i want yallyou to add and its to customize your keyboard!D but this app is amazing3
Not bad but i think itll be better if u can add more fonts and symbols are available on the keyboard (i mean on the letters) but overall its great
Great app! Very easy to use and there is lots of different fonts to use. This is an brilliant app i recommend this to anyone.
I like it! I always use it When im gonna name my pet in Adopt me And the other I can always chat it but sometimes it wil be like this i hate when that happen but i Love it This is only i can say for it and also i give this 5 stars For good not lagging though
I dont like this app because when I put it on my keyboard I got s virus and my other phone not working it still isnt. But I also like how u type with it and choose different kinds of fonts.

This is one of my favorite apps cause the fonts are sooo awesome. I love more this app cause is free and thats so cool...Like the Z generation says This app is a rockstar
This is a realy cool app!but i think you guys should add more styles just for fun and whene you type you get a sound like tinglike that but it realt doesnt bother me
Its good. But it has a very few languages. And it even lacks the English UK which is bad.
I like how the variety of options there is to text in different fonts. Also how you can make those text emojis is cool as well.

But for real it could maybe definitely use more fonts and maybe a little better ones if possible. Otherwise its an amazing fantastic app for fonts. Only gave it 4 so that way i can give it 5 when and if they add more fonts and hopefully some good ones. Overall 910 easily. Great app. Love it.
I really love this app as it is quock and easy to use. However I think it would be even better if it had more fonts and still had word predictions
You can switch back and forth between your normal keyboard and the fonts keyboard easily. There are many different emoji icons and fronts. Its a really cool app
It dorlesnt work for me if i didnt have taht problem I would rate it 5 Star if abnyoee tat does know hww to fix it plzls tell me

Love the size fonts and ease of use but I Swype to type 95 of the time.. So unless that feature becomes available I will continue with my other keyboards that Swype. Thanks!
This is app is really good I use it all the time but it sometimes takes up my storage but other then that I use it all the time and is awesome!
This is the best app to use for symbols and different fonts! The fonts are great and costs no money at all! Neither do the symbols!
This app is actually really cool and i honestly reccomend it!

Just one thing PLEASE remove the two vulgar characters from the top of the second tab or obscure them in a place where they are not easily visible. I am uninstalling now because I do not want to look at that and I advise others to not install if that kind of visual bothers you.
Love that I dont have to copy and paste anymore for mobile it was so annoying... Give us more fonts and I will be happy with this keyboard.
This app is easy to use it helps me when Im writing stories online. The only thing is that there are only few fonts. If the developer can add more fonts thatll be great.
Its nice and usefull but the emojis are really outdated and in somegames some fonts appears to be the box thingy but using other font app doesnt and the heart is kinda thin so ye not that much hate
I love the app and the different fonts but i have a suggeation could you please add an autocorrect bar at the top of the fonts please because if im trying to spell something i wont be able to know how to spell because there is no autocorrect bar so please add one.
These fonts are so cute and so fun to writetype with they really add more character to what youre typing and it really fun to look at as well I recommend this
I love this app it makes my typing so much better and I like the shapes. I IK T OT there is more likes than my one hatred about this app so I gave it a five star

I really love the keyboard but the problem is the the keyboard is to small and i keep mistaking the words and the space button has to ruin it. if you see my rate comment please fix this. Yes this is the most mistake I have Im an android Samsung tab.
The setup is very easy and simple. I love all of the different types of emojis and all of the fonts. This app is great if you want to add text to your photos or your own videos.
If you have a android you can get all the fonts and symbols for free and I lovr the design they have in theit fonts i just witsh you could make your keyboard a different theme or color but over all this app is great.

Really amazing app. I just love it!! and its very easy to use this app and the fonts are very nice. and i like every fonts. Such a Nice app
This app met more than my standards. Its just the fact that on portrait its fine and large but on landscape all the keys are very short. Please make it bigger! 45

It provides a lot of beautiful different fonts and after setting up the app with a click of 2 buttons I can change to my fonts keyboard. According to me this is a really good app. The only problem was that when my friends who were using apple products and other products which are not android the app said that you have to pay for Fonts Plus and dis not allow them to cancel it out and use the normal fonts app. Othervise overall loved it.
Great app. I wish i could swipe the letters to make a full sentence faster. Add that then this app will be 5 star worthy all around.
I love this app but Im using this in my tablet and i recommend this to my aunt because she loved the gothic font but when she installed the app in phone the gothic font isnt in one of the suggestions is it true(?)or its just my aunts phone not working lmao

its really good would definetely reccommend . The only problem is that there is no spellcheckerautocorrect which can be annoying when you have to type things out five times just to get the correct spelling
Absolutely great app. I love the variety of fonts and cute icons. I have nothing more to report other than that.
I reccommed everyone to use this example i love the app so much3 so far i dont have any bugs! Iwant you all to install this app like blodstone she is my fav yt! For all people reading this there is no bugs(() so pls install it!
The best of this app is that it had helped me to express my inner feelings within text. I would hv given you five stars but the app lack some features e.g prediction and spell checking as in other types of keyboard.
Good Application totally deserves 5 starts. I widh they had more intriguing fonts to put out the bland fonts we have in our common typing. Why dont you guys add Auto Correction. Something it saves from embarassing mistakes.

No problems everything is fine I like this fonts app its better and why would it be so hard THIS IS AMAZING!!!! All of them are my favourites
This app is amazing it is really easy to switch between keyboards and the fonts are so cute it is perfect
I really have to say its good. But I just installed it and I have trouble. I DONT WANT TO GIVE AWAY MY PERSONAL STUFF!!!!!!!!! Is there anyway that theres an option so you dont steal my mums money but still enable the fonts? That would really be a 5 star app right there if you made it that way

Lots of fonts to choose from
I wish u can control the hight of the keyboard...
I love this app costum keyboards Different fonts its just like the bestttt! No disructive ads No annoying pop ups!

Everything is amazing about this app but I wish there were more fonts and words prediction in it then I would have given it five stars.
I can type anything and the faces are so cute i would reccommand to make it how we want if we want and its just so usefull
Great app. Good for contact names
This is the best font keyboard! Im waiting for the numbers to include their own fonts too! Like has and so on... Im looking forward to this one!
Please Remove Switch Keyboard Option On Font Keyboard Its My Humble Request
Lovely App! 1 update I think will be good for people who cannot spell add there recently used words ( just an opinion) Otherwise its a great app
Its very nice app unlike the other. I already use this for almost 7 months so far it very good to use no ads so far.

Literally the best fonts keyboard out there. It would be greatly appriciated if a text prediction mechanism was added but except that the app is absolutely amazing!!
I like the app but the problem is that the buttons are to small for me and i kept making typing mistakes but i really like the fonts btw!
I wish you could change to different fonts by selecting text with the highligter on Android (critical rating to be read but honestly Id rate this a 45 bc it still doesnt have that feature and the autocomplete)
It is an amazing app ... I loved all the fonts in it. It dosent show any ad and I must recommend everyone to install this app...........
It works really well the other apps you have to pay for them which sucks. But it comes in handy when Im doing a project. 100 love this app
Its really cute but it took me a while to figure out how to but my regular keyboard to this keyboard but I think it was me because it had instructions but it was difficult for me personally to follow I dont know though
The app is really good just one tiny problem that there is no auto correct which makes my typing slower. Hope you add autocorrect soon.
Fonts always work well i always got a good font for the job and i also do love the custom emoji stuff like the lenny face and then some worth while app imo.
Lost one star because it takes time to change fonts to samsung keyboard and then Samsung keyboard. But its amazing.. My all friends keep me asking for this app.. Amazing calligraphy.. Just love it..
Its a good app but it will be good when you add theme. And it Doesnt have auto correction so it Make my Type slowed.
Great for the fonts and graphics. But no apostrophe on the main keyboard no auto capital at the beginning of the sentence.
It is really easy to use its fun but i rated 4 because u cant really use autocorrect or voice note. For the rest its awesome
Fun and I havent had any issues. I use it every now then would be nicer if it had a auto correct feature.

5 stars for me! The game is fantastic! There is no lag ads and is easily setup! Im so thankful to have a game like this
Dont get me wrong the app is very nice but unfortunately there isnt greek as a language so. Please you should add more languages in the near future
This is a great app yo use when you start to get bored of the font I suggest that you use this app cause there are several fonts to use.
I used to love it it worked fine in games i used it for a few months and it suddenly decided to not work.And its sad bc i gave feedback.nothing was told what was wrong and its not fixed.And i love the cute emojis and fonts.Ugh.And its not my phone my phone is fine.
I dont like it a lil bit cuz its making my tab sometimes but its so cool and can you add more symbols?its gonna be so fun if you add more symbols(Sorry about my grammar Im not pure American ) )
Its interesting for who wanna play fonts on new feed
This app is really great! i dont have any issues or bugs interrupting me while using this but i wish that theres more fonts but ill give it 5 stars )
It is such a nice experience to use it! U must add a option to convert it directly in urdu keyboard. Except it it is a best keyboard.

This is the best one our there! Most are bad or are for apple but this is awsome for both! I only gave it four starts coz i think they should asd more fonts but otherwise its perfect
The fonts for alphabets are good. But it doesnt work for number. I hope can improve for numbers.
Though this is the best app for keyboadds i know i wish there were more options of fonts and the share app icon could be hidden. Or if there could be an option so that we could choose to remove few icons.

App works super well i love all the fonts and the custom stuff like or . its so wonderful!
I love this app its very good and the best part is that the maximum space it takes its very small storage.. so if u are confuseecto download it then dont be worried this app is the besttt
Perfect no ads at all and straight to the point. If only there were more fonts though.
This is a wonderful app! Im speechless. It has many cool fonts. And not so many adds! Im impressed of this hard work
This app is pretty cool here are examplesKh and i liked it but i i think you need to add more fonts like normal fonts but a bit of stylish i hope you read this i will give this 5 stars if this get fixed
I love the app very much cuz i always wanted apfonts but my problem is if i Enter it my screen turn a lil bit white but no worries no lag no bugs no anything Except the lil bit of white screen 3
i love this app but a lot of the fonts advertised arent there like typewriter emoji etc. Otherwise it is a great app!
This is a good app and all but i wish it had auto correct and that you could swipe the letters and i make the word. I also would like the periods and the other things on there as well. That is why i gave it four stars. Fix this and i will for sure give you five stars.
great app! so many amazing fonts easy to set up and its free. its so helpful! i think im obsessed. only down side is that the puncation and numbers are always the same normal font. besides that its an amazing app and i love it!
Hello developers! I really love this app. However I think you should put more symbols like arrows symbols or something... Overall its the best font app ever
I love it! its easy to use thogh it is a little bugger than my older keyboard but it still works fine. I love the emoji options especially
It has amazeing fonts! But on some apps when i put in some fonts it dose tags but its not ur problem well i see no problems with this app its just absouloutly great!
Italics are nice especially for apps like messenger instead of using all caps which looks like you can use the app for !
Well what I love about this app is that they have so many different fonts to from the fonts are really crazy with I love and theres even special emojis things
This is a really good app the fonts are really cute however if you want to type fast dont recommend because the keyboard is a bit slow
I love it but I think it needs more like the auto correct feature cuz I go to roblox (yes Im a kid) and I cant remember my roblox name when I log out cuz I need to share with my brother and he gets in his account but I cant cuz I dont remember my roblox name ya.
45 his app is very nice i recomend u getting it the only problem is it keeps showing you rate this app sign even if u have rated it But apart from that its amazing
Its a good app wonderful even the main problem is that it does not have dyslexic sympathetic font which is why I downloaded the app in the first place
I really love this app..bcz of itz cool fonts style..i can easily write any thing which one i want to highlight
I have just started using this app and its good and works well but there isnt auto correct so you have to know what to spell when you type a word. Past that its a good app
Its ok just one pet peeve of mine is the fact it doesnt have predicted speech up the top. Aside from that I like the fact that you can switch from normal keyboard to font keyboard quickly.
Its a good fonts app but if you can let us change the shape like size or changing the backgrounds into pictures add some stickers add more languages like (arabic .......) i hope you do these things
If you have been looking for the fonts here you are. Kindly doa download. I wound like to say thanks to this App. The fonts are truly amazing . Moreover it is very easy to use.
Its a great app for things like snapchat instagram tiktok youtube and much more its also a good app just to use cute fonts and symbols in messages and emails i reccomend this to EVERYONE!!
Its bewn really good. I enjoy the personalized customization of my phone that I can do with this app. The only thing I miss is the lack of suggestions. I miss not having to type everything out (Ive gotten spoiled lol) its a bit inconvenient.

pretty good I occasionally need to uninstall the app because the keyboard doesnt appear. other than that its good )
For the sake of human decency please make this readable on TextToSpeech features Voice Overs and Screen Readers. This app is so insensitive (ableist even) towards people with Dyslexia and people who are visually impared.
This app is really helpful on me! It helps me to make my edits acc better and using fantastic fonts.. but if you add more fonts in this app I will rate this 5 star
The app is easy to use. The only feature Id like is the autocorrect. The app will be the best if the autocorrect and some more fonts are added
It is good app. I like it. It is useful for me. When I need Myanmar Language I have to change another keyboard.
I gave this 2 stars Because If I Go To The Fronts App It Wouldnt Let Me Use The TypeWriter And Script and more fronts even if i already updated it thousands of times please fix this really worst bug.
its really good I honestly use it on a daily basis I havent had any problems with it other than the ones Ive had on the devices keyboard as well.
This is by far the best fonts app Ive found! I absolutely reccomend this! thank you for not being a ripoff scam.
This app is very good for fonts but some of them are a bit laggy and dont let me use.
This app is great. I always use the different fonts and emojis when texting my friends.
I felt in love with this u can change ur font and they even have some text emoji that isnt on our keyboard and i just love u can change it back to normal if u want to the font is just perfect i love it
This is an Amazing App!!! but it has alot of choices to pick wich took me 25 min to pick but overall great app!
This app is amazing it doesnt change the look but it gives u so many different fronts the only bad thing is sometimes things cost money but I highly recommend this app

Love this app! Unlike other font apps you dont have to pay to get certain fonts! I use it everyday!!
Easy to use and a lot of options works perfectly and keyboard options are customizable.
This app is amazing! You can choose between many different fonts and you can use cool faces as well. My only problem is that when you type a word and you spell it wrong it will leave it as it is and it wont change it to the actual word so this makes it very hard for me to type.
The app is runs smoothly and is fun and easy to use but doesnt have auto correct and has a small variety of emojis.
I really love this app and I like the script font and clothic bit I need more font and try to give more fonts but overall I like this much
Absolutely great. The only thing it needs is a speak text funtion. Then it would be perfect.

Its super amazing and cute but it has to be avaliable on many other lauguages like arabic and it would be great if it had a number row at the top
I rate this app 5 star because it has a LOT of different and cool fonts to use when texting. I showed my friends and they thought it looked cool and I shared with them app link and they went and downloaded the apo too. These fonts are all amazing. This app fully deserves its rating.
Not bad has many amazing fonts. But one thing bothering me is the small caps font where they use the actually small s instead of making the bigger s small. It wouldnt be a big deal but in apps like snaptchat it might sometimes look wierd. Either way love it!

The app is overall good but at the same time the app is kinda forcing you to rate it. The only reason why im rating this is so it can stop telling me to rate the app. Thats why 2 stars are gone.The good thing is that there is no ads
Its very easy to use and I love how theres so many cool emojies and different fonts!
wow!! but... THIS. APP. IS. GREAT. That is for sure but.. Once i tried to change back to regular typing and my phone flipped out. It kept going to this starwalk app that a have yhat lets you see all of the stars. I never use it so i deleted it quickly and the problem dissapeared.. POOF!
Really fun theres not any ads its really easy fo use and its nice to use it to talk to friends
I love this app BUT I think they should let you keep autocorrect and let you change the theme of the keyboard but that is my opinion.
This is good and aap is new wark and old no wark
I love this app! It gives u pretty cool fonts and emojis too Im using this app cuz of that I just want some fonts! If u want new fonts download this app!
I love this so much! I Would live if they were more to pick tho!? something like hearts at the top of each letter or a nice wave like this at the start and end of a word to make it look cool but overall I love this app!

HI this app is verey good and instring I like it so much but 1 problem so many ads I dont like this and I am verry sad owterwise there are so many ads but I like it Fix So many ads And we need dollor to buy fonts
it is a cute app.. really enjoy it but there should be settings where a font should be chosen as default instead of all fonts annoying over the screen...pleass
I love this app it has no glitches or any bug like other fronts for keyboard apps.I love the fronts on here especially the accessories

Normally ny reviews are atleast 4 stars but with this app my daily standards WONT be reached everytine I type something on my apple device or my android it comes up with a redline saying that this is spelt wrong! My friend also downloaded this app and the same thing happened to her so I doubt that this is to do with my device change this PLEASE or bad reviews may stay bad reviews!
The app is amazing I think its very useful and easy to use but I put 4 stars because everyone says in the tik tok that its hacked and will take your data but Ive had it for a long time and nothings happened to my phone but you never know if its hacked but nevertheless Id give her five

Its a really good app i love all the fonts and other emojis! But theres a few problems some of the fonts lag a but and the letters go a little bit weird and crazy but if you could fix this i would give a 5 star!
Nice app but whats annoying is that it doesnt have that feature that learns words and suggests them as your typing.
It works awesome and it is very easy to change each keyboards and this font keyboard has many types of fonts.
I really love this app and i give 4 star because i want to request tmore fonts to update why? because i think many people would love and appreciate for this new update hehehe by the way thank youuuu for this app Keep safe everyone !
I love this app and its great the only thing i would add is auto correct but eh thats not THAT inportant overall great app and 1010 recomment!
Yeah nothing wrong with it but theres no correction and some times people cant read the other fonts yes its fine.download this cool app to have cool fonts
Almost perfect. If it has features like display suggestions when typing would be 5 star
Its super great with so much fonts and emojis . You can also type better too. I recommmend this app.
i really like it. im only giving it a four because it has no auto correct or auto suggest or clip board. i would also have appreciated more fonts. over all im enjoying it. the best thing is that i can switch from this keyboard to my other one. it has impressive emoji also
It was great. I could use this on ANY app with NO problems. There is plenty of fonts and emojis and faces that you could use. You can always switch to your original keyboard anytime you want. Its not complicated or anything ) !
This app is very cool i love how the fonts are displayed in a way that i dont get confused and its soo easy to use
Nothing to describe yet its still a long way. the button to move to the next line of paragraph is malfuctioning. It just send the message straight up anytime its pressed instead of moving to the next line. Its frustrating.
I love it so much!! I really love all the fonts and 2. I really recommend it for like editing and now for some recommendations So I think you should add a broken heart and maybe more? But yeah I really record it!! 1000000010
I love this app i gave it 5 stars because well its just amazing love who ever is reading this compliment download FontsFont Keyboard
My old review was cringe so id say from past experience this app is a simple quick and stylish keyboard for fonts
Very good and cool using app Download this app and enjoyed
This is a awesome app and it helps us to write in different fonts and we can make our text very attractive.
Amazing. Easy to use and trusty and even has some things i didnt expect in there. Just brilliant app would reccomend
This app is amazing it helps me a lot for fonts and its pretty amazing and it also dont have disturbing ads you cant test it too
by far the best app for fonts ive run across everything is free and i havent run into any bugs so far. Though i think itd be nice if youd add auto correct thanks for reading!
I love this app thank u for making this i love itBecause i need to make pretty font for my YouTube name and this is the best app ever ive ever seen even its offline! I Love This!!!
App is really cool and easy to use. Ive had it for some time now and it still works. Usually apps like these after some time start glitching but this one still works fine. Definitely recommend downloading
The app is extremely easy to use! i use it for my discord server and its been working perfectly.
Really really nice I like how you can change your fonts while my keyboard has no fonts but maybe you should like upgrade the apps because I wanted to have fonts and a keyboard wallpaper to Mach obviously and yes I reset my original one but now Im truly aesthetic in this account like lets just say ...Full ReviewReally really nice I like how you can change your fonts while my keyboard has no fonts but maybe you should like upgrade the apps because I wanted to have fonts and a keyboard wallpaper to Mach obviously and yes I reset my original one but now Im truly aesthetic in this account like lets just say its my main account and currently if you make it work thank you so much I very appreciated if you can have a keyboard wallpaper and some fonts if that will do thanks oh and good app nice fonts bye
Actually is is pretty good app but i am giving 1 star because we cant change the language and thats why i dont like this app and this app with be better if you added more fonts
This app is so simple to use and so cool there is so many fonts I enjoy it install it !! Its really cool
Great app! It has loads of fonts and different like emoji things too I reccomend. The only downsides would be that the keyboard is a bit hard to get use to with bigger keys and there is no word suggestions.
I personally live this app. I can do things in cute fonts for my apps! I rate 55 ! I suggest you get it!
Nice exprience while writing in different modes or style and one of the best thing i feel while writing it gives a large keyboard size it is ( AD FREE )
I really like this app. It has a few glitches here and there overall its great ]
WTAF?!! After downloading and before selecting to use this keyboard a warning comes up saying that this input method may be able to collect all the text that you type including personal data passwords and credit card numbers NO THANKS. Uninstalled the app straight away. Dodgy as hell.
Its an amazing app its so aimple to use i love the fonts and the emojis i recommended this app but as some people have said it does need more fonts and emojis
Im satisfied about it but theres still room for improvement you can add more emoticons and fonts and Ill give u 5 full stars!
I really love this app but... Every time I tried to type a name in gacha club the keyboard wont even shows up!
I gave 5 stars cause it was easy to use Its awesome I love this app. You should download this chat!
its been nice using fonts people always ponder how i write like that and the comments positive and cool my suggestion is make the number bar show on the top of the first interface its not always cool when u want to type fast amd you have to go to another interface. remain free
Amazing it has so many symbols i have been searching an app like this love it but i recommend for more symbols
This app is great only it doesnt show the keyboard when I have to type in a name for my gacha Character.. So I rate it . Other than that I really like this app!!
Id love that they actually had autocorrect built into it but I love the app its so easy to use.
Very interesting app There are many languages you can write I suggest that that you have to use this app there are many many fonts I give 5 stars . Thanks you
I love It the only problem Is that doesnt have autocorrect (
Its Helpful And Easy To Type
I love this aa fonts most of the time without any reason so i gave 5star cause its satisfy my needs and i use this aa fonts in every new devices i use Thanks for such an beautiful fonts
Really great app but have some problems Can you add search button? Some of my app does not respond on that arrow button below the erase button. Sometimes when I was in the middle of typing a message the keyboard just close and when I try to type again it will close after a few letters Please Fix
Sadly It doesnt work on my oppo phone and I started struggling about some unique fonts that I will use litirally wont appear. It does well on my samsung tablet though theres a lot of nice fonts and emojis.
I love using these fonts for multiple things they are fun and pretty easy to access! I really dont find anything wrong with the app!
this app is very good but it depends on the cell phone. if the phone is samsung j2 like mine it doesnt show all fonts. but if your cell phone is another samsung some iphone or motorola it appears.
Im inlove with the fronts! However theres one problem.I always need to swip the fronts one to another so its getting kinda annoyingI hope i can switch the orders of fronts myself so it would be more convenient for me to use them.Thankyou
This app is really good! I have gone through some lags but not many! I recommend this! To any aesthetic players!
Best app of fonts I have used a app like this for the first time and I really loved it ... Such an amazing font styles ... Am in love with them
I like this app but I though if my friend use fonts I can read it after I download this (I use Android) But no. And it so unfair. Iphone can watch after download this and have more fonts than Android have. Plus they have Kaomoji too. But Android didnt have. Plz fix it
I mean as far as fonts apps go this one is pretty solid a good selection of fonts and its pretty accessable
This app is great I dont use the fonts for everything but when i get the chance there are many crazy but cool options.
This app is amazing! You have diffrent fonts and you get other emojis and I had no problem using this app but if your trying to spelling and hoping that you wont have auto correct if you download this app. Overall I like this app and you should give it a try! ^^
I am a fan page of zoe laverne in tiktok and used this app for good font I really love this app thanks to the owner this app helps me a lot with my videos I am happy that I found a good app for my videos but the bad thing is when u type something in a game the screen becomes grey and I hate it pl...Full ReviewI am a fan page of zoe laverne in tiktok and used this app for good font I really love this app thanks to the owner this app helps me a lot with my videos I am happy that I found a good app for my videos but the bad thing is when u type something in a game the screen becomes grey and I hate it please fix this thank you!Express yourself the way you want
I really like this app because we have to not pay any money and in this app all the fonts available
app is totally safe it does NOT save the words you type i scanned it with s lot of antiviruses and none found anything.
So far so good. I enjoy every font and emoji. Three major issues are when I need to enter my password or tag a friend on Facebook or IG I have to go to back Normal font. And when I copy paste something it does not give me those cute fonts I like. Can you guys work that please?
Super easy to use and theres so many emojis to use really fun i recommend this app Those emojis i used from this app really really like it!!!!
I love this app. It gives you many different fonts to write and I loved them all
i like it so much! but the h on my non bold serif broke i think or is it just like this in the first place? can u pls fix it if it isnt? i will be glad )

Pretty cool app different fonts to chose from and type from right in your keyboard. just one thing I wish it had was autocorrect and word suggestions. Especially for fast typers like myself. If you add this feature it will be 5 stars worthy Perfect
Its an amazing app if Im being honest but its kind of hard to use because the keyboard isnt the same as the original one I always mess up my typing. I understand this is probably how the keyboards meant to go but sometimes it can be annoying
Like this app is so cool! There is many font and my friend reccomand me this app all my friends use this app! Ty for this app that make me use aesthetic fonts!
I love the game it is amazing but I would love if you add more front and more faces you can make but the app is already amazing so good job on making the game

This app is cool but why does mine doesnt have the script typewriter outline and more font just like the picture?Is it depends on phone? I really want that type of fonts thats why I installed it.

I gave it 5 stars because it helps us because it gives examples of letters and its also good to use. I like this app
Fantastic app runs great even on slower devices and i really like the dark theme the only things i think it needs is an autocorrect system and sounds for the keys...like a typewriter or something.Other than that 1010
I love this app its so pretty and its easy to use. It has some great fonts
I love the app!! Tho i hope u can add more features like predictive text autocorrect changing the height and layout of the keyboard and option to turn of auto capitalisation. Thank you!
i love it its easy to use and the the fonts were stylish. I love em this app deserves 5 stars hope you can add some amazing fonts keep improving and God Bless Be safe! ( )
Good app and no issues about this app
I love almost all of it. The few parts that Im not loving is that there is no prediction bar and it doesnt automatically correct your typos. Those are two things a keyboard defintely needs.
Its really cool i love it so much. When i type with a font to my friends they get so shocked and excited. Thanks so much for making this app
Its very good app... Please add new extra emojis please ... Some emojis comes like a box symbol in message instagram.. so please add That extra emojis otherwise its wonderful app

The app on iPhone makes you pay for extra fonts but the app on Android gives you them for free.
This is an amazing app! it usually help me in my keyboard to do other thin glimmerings like emojis
This is the best font app I had ever used. 1. It has lots of different styles 2. It has cute and cool emojis And that all but the rate the app keeps popping up when I open the app to use it.
I Like All The Difrent Styles And Defrent Ways You Can Use The Lettering Very Cool
I like all the cool and fun fonts but there is some minor problems. But overall it is fun to use to text people and use on snapchat and other platforms as such.

is completely good but no layoutsize customization no long press no color customization but its completely free and has tons of useful stuff
Keyboard height is much more than expected in my 6.3 screen.. add feature for adjusting height in preferences!

Not just emojis either there are so many different fonts that you can use in everyday things like Facebook messaging or SnapChat messaging even emails. ( ) s now I just wish there was Swype or talk to text options.
Very nice app and well arranged to use but kindly add auto correct feature inside it. Thank you!
Lots of font choices. Better than copypaste font converters. I just wish it had arrow keys and a caps lock option. I prefer to use Microsoft SwiftKey as my default switch to Fonts as needed.
I really enjoy this app! It has different fonts and makes it prettier to use
This app is good kinda i make mistakes but overall nice i love to experiment with fonts
Its the best app for fonts but it will be better if we get more emoticons like whatsapp The emoticons here are pretty less
i love how everything is free on andriod and not on apple. i have all the cool fonts and symbols and its judt SO CUTE
this app is the best! It works on every gadget!!! It even has 42 fonts! And more i suggest you to download this app if your looking for fonts and you can create a cute hack using this app! help this app reach 1B dowloads !!!
Its an fonts app but it can get stuck and that sucks sometimes and can be vary useless but other then that I would say its a good font app.
I absolutely love this app and I recommend you to install it.Thanks for making this app but i hope youll add more kinds of fonts..But all over its very nice I really really love it.
I really love the app it has really great fonts! I would love more fonts so if u add more fonts I will give it a full 5 stars !
I really like it! i love editing my bio on instagram and adding cute fonts with it D
Awesome! Best keyboard so far but is there a way we can hide the toolbars on top of it? Its kinda weird but i might use to it sooner. But there should be an option for that. Also you dont have much on your settings the rest are good.
This app is best for font BEST

Great app to use highly recomend using this app ive had a fun time with this
Amazing app. I totally love it.
My experience with this app is awesome Heres a tip pls add the type writer font which u show in the playstore i hope u will in next update
They dont automatically make a sentence capitalized and some of their stuff is inappropriate but overall I like it.
Very nice app and irs very easy to use .Fonts are very nice .sinoly superb
Fonts is a great app. There are so many unique and fun fonts.
Love the keyboard and the fonts it makes me so comfortable but I have a few problems the problem is you need to share the link to a friend to use other fonts but its fine love the app.
The app is rlly great! I can use the fonts for roblox roleplay names and naming my adopt me pets and the fonts add style to the words. One problem is u have to double tap to open ur keyboard or wait a long time for the keyboard to open so pls fix that thx
Sometimes my last contact word disappear and it makes me mad also i hope that it will not disappear after i resave it again
Ive been using this App for a month and its pretty handy .but I thought it worked on WhatsApp .when I send a message the receiver only sees little boxes pliz fix that problem
The app is great could have given it 5 stars but when typing it doesnt suggest words for you. But all in all the app is cool keep it up
Its pretty good but it has some bugs 1). When you are typing a bit fast it autocapitalise the first two or three letters. 2). And of course no autocorrect why Anyways pretty good fonts tho
Just awesome im enjoy this app very beautyful style and update emoji just very awesome but 1 But one more feature needs to be added.That is the word recommendation and Google Translate.
i use it all the time. Although it would be better if it had autocorrect but thats just a preferance! overall pretty great!
Such a useful and helpful app I really love it!!! I wish you add Arabic language )
This app is so beautiful.. but they have to increase the stylish symbols... i wish they will increase
This is the best keyboard I ever seen it has plenty of fonts but I also want them to add new if they can also one thing more if they can add a clipboard in the keyboard then I will give him a 5 star rating
I love this app I hd another one its just like this one but I had to pay for most of them I hope your app gets millions of more downloads!
It very good but some times it makes my phone to overheat that why i rate it if u wanna download it make sure your phone is andriod10 or above if is iphone atleast from ios 12later
This app is amazing so many amazing fonts emojis and more! But the only promblem it asks u for all ur info
I really love this app I have no problems with it. Its really great and I also told my friends about it and they loved it as well. I really recommend this app.
Very good app For free use if you can add corrective mode when typing a word.
I will give this 5 stars because this app has many fonts and fun to type with! But you should add more fonts ^^
I love this app it is amazing and it has little animals and lots of fonts
I mean its an amazing app but the reason I rated it 4 starts bec uh It sometimes crashes suddenly and it dont let me type idk why but I would be thankful if you tried to fix this crashing problem maybe I could change my mind and rate it 5 starts.
I really like the app! It would get even better if you add other keyboard settings such as word predictions and others.
I think this app so best because writing beautiful
1010 !! All the fonts are free ! It also give you cute symbols !!
Why does it say you will never collect personal data but when you turn fonts on it brings up a notice saying that the app will collect all data and c.c. numbers. What kinda b.s. you trying to pull???
Good! It has no ads and that makes it soooo good.
I like this app and i think you should get it because you can get different fonts and there is a emoji section that is really cool.
great app love sending fonts in arguments or to my friends at special moments
Id definitely give 5 stars if the rate us popup window wasnt so large.
All I can say is that the Fonts keyboard is the best but what I dont really like about it is that it doesnt have all the emojis and the faces like this one ( ) (`)
h is different on serif and g is different on script. I dont know if my phone is the problem or the app but other than that the app is great!
This is a really good app for fonts you get a bunch of fonts in on keyboard I highly recommend
(Rose servitovas daughter) Its kinda annoying i cant play roblox. The chat wont load. I think you should maybe put up a setting so you can turn off the keyboard and go back to it when you want to. Thanks
Its a really good app yoi get cool fonts and little emoji things like this or its just really cool. The only problem i have is that theres no auto correct but not really a big deal.
Its quite nice i havent faced any problems while using it the only reason on why I reviewed 4 stars is there needs to be more fonts other than that its quite nice so good job.
its got a variety of fonts that you can use pretty much anywhere s . its really cool and i reccomend giving it a try
Amazing! Fonts can be accessed really easily but this app lost a star because there is no autocorrect at all. !
Ive just installed it.... its acceptable as i have to use to check it out ... but there is so no symbol available ..only emojis... plus it dosent suggests words on the top of keyboard ..as provided by google service!
Its a pretty good app. Different styles n pics that ive always wanted. Thank you so much.
Fonts is so cool ypu get tones of cool fonts and emojis but there is only one thing there is no autocorrect but other than that it is a great app and you shpuld definitely cosider getting it.
Nice keyboad app for easy typing!
I looove this. Lots of easy tp access fonts and emojis no spell check though.
This app is awesome I really love it except the fact that sometimes the letter i and n can be broken and it has no autocorrext but i can deal without them ))
I really like this app the only thing is it chews up my battery pretty fast..
Its works so well! I would give this app about a 9 star! It works on like every app!even TikTok!!
pretty cool but add a function to turn auto caps off i hate having to manually turn it off edit cant use backspace in terminals and ssh clients still works
fonts are great but i wish theres more varieties that are actually good. and also i hope they update their language and emojis so its a more fun experience!
I love it! Just 4 stars because when you type it doesnt correct what you type. Also wish for color fonts!!! Still love it!
Honestly its just the best except that its kind of different from the usual keyboard. I really recommend it though there are no problems after downloading it!
Have a great experience but some founts depend on others phones model that it suport that fount to show otherwise founts show like small size boxes.
Love the app so many fonts . No adds either .Thanks!
It is a great experience. But you need to improve in aitomatic corrector and some accents
Perfectly serviceable keyboard alittle unwieldly in places and some missing features that would be nice but its fine.
I love this app.I give it a 4 stars.This is amazing but you would add more font.
THIS IS THE BEST . but a problem is that it does not put in the does noy have auto correct
Best app in the history of every app for fonts.(for me)I really appreciate it and love it but please make it able to add backgrounds..it would be the bestest keyboard in the world...
I love it i love how it is free and the fonts are great! this is a good app. It does what it tells you and it works wonderfully.
This is app was so goood but please add more fonts theres not completed please add more and add emoji and symbols please fix it pretty
Very fun I love all the types of fonts and symbols! I enjoy using it whenever I can!
It is a good app and it is useful when i want to make videos in different kind of .
This application is fantastic but it should also work on the number keys and some of the selections do not.p
This app (fonts) is really cool... I love the Serifs... font ( ) one of my fav. But u cant change the keyboards color but its cool ...
This app was really cool! Altough if ur gonna copy of past u cant and i was strugling to find it but it was worth it sometimes i uninstall it cause i need to go to past sometimes but i still love it!
App is amazing! Everything is awesome......but you should add another languages in app anyway I use only this
I really like using this its super easy and you can use alot of different variety of fonts.
well made app but not really for me also slightly concerned that it says they can see everything i type although I suppose i can switch fonts off when im doing passwords
I love the app and all and it says it works on all apps but on roblox nothing works not even the emoticons and this is a bit frustrating good app overall though minus that detail
GREAT APP!! LOVED IT...... THE FONTS AND EMOJIS WERE SO CUTE )) DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TO USE IT 33
This app is good. But unfortunately it doesnt support on many mobile phones. Many of my friends cant see my messages while using this app. And its really irritating.
It is an amazing app the different types of fonts and emojis.
Good I just want to suggest to make it more appealing like changing the backgroundtheme.
This app have a very unique and beautiful writing... Thanks Fonts Font Keyboard app!!!
This app is so good no bugs no glitches just that some of the things cant be seen on discord on my laptop but thats not the apps fault cause i can see it on my phone so no problemes at all!
The reason why i gave three stars is because it doesnt have some options in some devices like mine while there are more options in devices like my sisters...pls look into this matter. But you guys never do that so its no use giving feedback so pls even stop telling us to give feedback...
Very good fonts and so much different fonts. I like this app
this app used to be really cool and aesthetical then you limited all the fonts and left the.... notsoreallycoolones???????!!!!!!! Please fix
I love this app it is so simple and fun I dont have any trouble and the emoji are so fun and cool
Great keyboard app has way more than I expected. The only thing its missing is text prediction but other than that its a great app! ^^
Great fonts more options such as spell correction would be nice.
This app is very good . It has good symbols fonts and emojis too. You can switch to this apps fonts anytime and use your devices original keyboard also

In some fonts the particular single letter does not print in given type this is the problem with certain letters Eg. see the letter h in this its different

I like the overall font very much but i wish there were numbers key above the letters one. It would make a whole lot difference if it does.
it is fine but the keypress sound does not work and sometimes my keyboard glitches so. 2 stars.
Very Nice App. Please add some more Fonts ( from movies games like God of War Transformers etc. Also ) please please please add.
i really like how there is a varity of fonts and they also come with cool emojis(here are a few) but if you do download you dont have autocorrect with it
This is a great app I love it you should download it but it doesnt auto correct but thats fine lol but this is the best font app 1010 recommend]
The fonts are so cool there are a lot of different fonts and they are unique. They also work on all apps
I rate 4 stars cause the app is really awesome i really like it but in some of its own emojis are not that much but its still so good
its way better than the first fonts app i had (1 i has no locks) (2 it has emojis that it did not have because the fonts app i had lied) I RECOMEND
I really love this app but I really recommend adding more fonts
Its nice and all but i sometimes lag and my writing stops but its a good app so far.
This keyboard is amazing I definitely like the fonts and emojis Id like the spell check feature though even though I was using simple keyboard without pretty much everythung
i really love this font and i really enjoyed and i think you have add some new letters and some bts Army emoji
