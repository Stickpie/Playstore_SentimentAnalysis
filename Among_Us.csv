You can bond with people easily and can actually speak about why you think someone is the imposter. The new chat system is terrible and takes too much time to use. Just censor out words like you used to and let is chat amongst others
"Unbelievably Awesome Among Us is a great game,  which you could play for hours I dont know and understand why the hell people have started to stop playing it,  as now it has so many new features like New Graphics,  Illustrations,  and many more things I personally love this game"
"It was a good and nice game. I thought it was a great game. Until the update,  you cant choose you name anymore,  you cant type,  and after every meeting I had I couldnt move. So its a meh now.

Edit it has gotten better,  you can type tou own name and chat,  there are also new colors and things to wear. A much better game now. And I can walk now after a meeting."
"Its quite a good game but a bit buggy at times. 1.) The admin bug on airship(maybe not only airship) when a report or meeting is called when I am on or even near the admin thing,  even when I report the body,  I get stuck and am not in the meet.

The admin bug on airship(maybe not only airship) when a report or meeting is called when I am on or even near the admin thing,  even when I report the body,  I get stuck and am not in the meet. Not only that,  the meeting continues until I get kicked. 2.) Sometimes the game bugs out completely when a meeting or body is called. Everyone has to leave. Or maybe it is a hack. If at least those 2 issues above are fixed,  I can confidently give 5."
"The airship update sucks... 1. The map itself lags when the game starts 2.

The Quick Chat is very frustrating that I didnt play among us anymore,  and you really need to give your gurdians email to get normal chat 3. It isnt fun anymore cause its getting more and more boring every game cause when youre an imposter and you want a kill or youre a crewmate and you want to finish your task,  many people press the emergency button even though they have no concerns or suspicions Please fix these, "
It has occurred to me that there is a sudden increase in game cheatersexploiters. From events such as everyone dying to us being able to be ghosts in the lobby. The game is definitely broken. I honestly see this game having some potential but its hard to enjoy it when these things are occuring
"I hate the updated conversations its so boring and tedious for me to go through and do that,  it was much better before you changed it.

I do like the new maps but I dont like that you cant type your own name, I get people put inappropriate stuff before but you already had a chat censor and it would have been easier if you just censored the names or banned them . These changes make the game boring to play sorry not sorry "

Please do something or Ill delete this game.

Edit Can you guys also fix the bug where it says sent six pings that remote didnt respond to because it is dum and messes up gameplay since it kicks you out of a game when you are in the middle of the game

Instead of disableding the chat pls disable offensive language.

And sense the player cant do much as a imposter ghost it would be a good idea to add a power to control a cremate for 15 seconds so you can try to get them up to in imposter for a kill. Also Polus is a cool map there should be more planets and bases. Maybe a elevator to. Last Idea is to add a electrician job. I hope innersloth replies back

Its just unbearably unoptimized but we cannot forget that among us is the game that makes pandemic easier for almost all of us )

The best thing I could ever install. All I wish is the government of this game could add the typing again. But it is still on the 5 star rate. I would uninstall this game if I want to. For the last time fix it PLEASE. I am unintalling this game in a WEEKS TIME. FFFFFIIIIIXXXXX IIIIITTTTT

"The game is really good amd I guess it was the first game which started the imposter type games. But the thing is that after playing this same kind of game for a long time,  it starts getting boring. So I suggest add a few modes. But unique,  of course like you people always do."
"I LOVED the old version of among us and used to play it all the time. But when I saw the update I wasnt happy at all its annoying cause you cant type freely and you have to sign in and all. Thats why I liked the old version, you can play freely and can name your own among us oc anything you wish."

And Im not trying to be a Karen or anything but honestly the amount of young kids that I know that love this game scares me.

I used to LOVE playing this game. I played it more than my son...but its no longer as fun as it once was. I suggest having age brackets as far as the chat is concerned. The quick chat responses take way too long to get to.
"What makes me like this game the most is the communication. I like how we can talk to each other. But since the day you stopped free chat and made us use quick chat,  its not fun anymore. Please return the free chat. Please Please Please"

This game is good but a little unfair. For 5 days I havent been able to be an Impostor. Today I got to be an Impostor 3 times but it is disconnecting me. Otherwise it is really good game. Like it Please fix the problem.

"Before I used to absolutely like this game but after time progressed,  the liking for it rapidly started declining due to others leaving by not getting imposter and also the fact that I never became imposter for many,  many matches although I was patient when I was. It still remains quite fun though"
"in my opinion,  its so much better when you can freely chat,  not pick a word,  just chat,  if you bring back that feature it would be excellent and it will bring so much nostalgia and old players of among us ))"

I love everything about the game except one thing pretty much And thats the game chat yes there should be an option to talk out loud but you should still be able to type what u need to say . I dont like that u cant say anything bin text chat except the pre made statements and questions.
"Among use to be a fun,  simple game. Then the developers were like lets make a game where you cant even communicate except for what bullcrud they give u to chat with. Not ok,  I will not be playing till I hear back from the developers."

"It sucks. I didnt even get to play properly oh Forget about online I cant even play it offline it blacks out,  tried reinstalling it back but still the same issue it keeps on blacking out and glitching everytime I open the app. Want the old version where it was all good."
This game is good but there is a problem... Quick Chat I absolutely hate it You cannot even type in it. We can only use the wordssentences given by the game. It is not fair as communication has to be there between crewmates discussion. This is the reason I give this game only 3 stars.

I loved playing among us ever since it was popular and its a great game. But the way the chat works now makes the game no fun. Its hard to communicate or even start conversations. The only way u can really enjoy the game with others is by playing in a voice chat and a custom game.

Good game. The only real problem that I had was that they could have put the parental control mode thing on permanently instead of having the quick chat. For me the quick chat takes longer to use than just typing.

To name one is that the chat function is terrible because even if you dont sign in then you should be able to chat normally. The developers have made this game officially dead. Just look at the ratings and gameplay. This is just what they did to Fortnite. They added to many updates and desquinguisted the fun of it. This was once my favourite game... tis no longer.

Now you can no longer speak freely and you are limited of the amount of chat options,  which is very annoying and I really liked the old version with 3 maps which causes less confusion and the chat situation makes the experience terrible for people on a mobile device. I do like the idea of more people,  but I still like the old version of the game. I hardly play it but I would if the old game was back. ("
"This was really good,  until the update. You cant get your own name,  but worst of all is you cant say your own things in the chat. Like just using random sentences that you did not even write. Please change this and this will 5 stars."

Ive done a 2 star review but i changed my mind when one of the developers answered me and told me that there is in fact free typing chat opposed to only commands. Aside from that i had no problems with the game in fact its a great game

Among us used to be the best game to play with friends but now you cant chat or name yourself. It would be 5 stars if it werent for those updates. Anyway this is still okay i guess its just not as fun as it used to be.

EDIT I decided to come back to the game to see if anything has changed. No. Still the same problem,  hackers just ruin it for everyone else. I really wanted to like this game but its nearly unplayable when not in a party."
"I really loved this game,  but the new update makes it unplayable.( The names just randomize,  and not can normally chatting. I fell really sad for this update,  cus this is one of my favorite game. Make this game again the nice game what we are loved.."
"This game used to be incredible Being able to play with and FREELY communicate with others around the world was an awesome experience. We could discuss real world concerns and controversial topics. Well,  I wont be paying for the opportunity. Nice job ruining the potential with greed."
The crashes are unbelievable. My internet is fine. All my other apps work fine. I get into a good game and suddenly Im disconnected. Half the game gets disconnected as well. Unbelievably frustrating
"I love to play this game,  but recently It hasnt been letting me online even though my internet is good. Overall good game and Im glad they added chat back. I will change to five stars if this bug is fixed"

Secondly I get into a 1 or 2 imp lobby and for the 1 imp there are sometimes 2 of them instead."
"It is very good game to spend time with your friends,  or relatives. My only one problem is that when you chat something that is not bad,  they putting  ,  so sometimes they didnt understand what Im saying."

The new colors seem pretty cool and the new map but its just not the same. Its gotten boring now. But if you just changed the chat then it would make the game a whole lot better. And also you need a lot of personal info just to change your name to what you want."

My last review of the game was bad but now where I found out that you can change quick chat to free chat makes the game better. The game isnt dead but it isnt as addictivefun as it used to be in October or in December. Still a good game that I recommend)
"Well first the game is still fun,  just not how it use to be. The quick chat update is taking all the fun out,  and the fact that you have to have a name that you dont like is taking even more fun away. And Im tired of it Change it BACK Please"

It was way better before than it is now mainly because they changed communication between players an made it more difficult to text especially if youre new to the game. I still give a 4 star because In all it is a great game.
"I would give this game five stars but,  its completely unplayable. It works fine until I click play online. It stopped working all together after I got the new update. Im so disappointed..."

This game is great i love to play it but the problem is that the quickchat. Its awful. The quickchat is supposed to me quick but its take more time. Many times i have tried to tell that the imposter vented in front of me. But there is no line about that. Pls remove the quick chat.

I especially like to play with my friends and family. I give this app 4 stars I dont like being banned or picked on for my players name which is LBGTQ. That is my only complaint. I ALSO dont like the new chat feature I think you should keep it but also allow people to edit their own comments in.
"This game is actually quite fun. I like the simplicity inside,  but there are too many hackers and its too easy to meet hackers in game. Hackers have been ruined the experience of the game. Please banned those hacker accounts permanently."

The new chat system for younger audiences is absolutely atrocious. The random name generations make it really hard to talk to each other. Either get rid of it or change the chat system. (Like use colours instead of names.
Its good but there is 1 problem its the chat box update pls remove that pls the so called fast talk isnt actually fast its less ez to talk so instead of just fast talk fast talk should be optional and the player should be able to type what heshe needs to say.

"Good game,  really fun,  but often it glitches and wont load the screen,  or doesnt load the lobby Im trying to join. Edit Hi It seems my complaints have been and this went from a 45 to a 55"
"Its awesome,  but one thing,  the new chat feature is horrable. I liked it better when you could type what ever you want. i want to be able to pick my own name. rn my name is wisedog.the newer map is great too."
"I use too like this game ,  but when the new airship update came out ,  it ruined the game ,  the one thing that I hated the most was quick chat ,  it was so annoying ,  and thats why I gave it 2 stars ,  if you bring back free chat ,  I would give it a 5 star"

Cant connect to server no matter what fixes I try. I even Uninstalled and reinstalled. Still cant get it to work. Great time passes before that though ....please fix this before I completely stop using this game and leave it for good.
"It was one of my favourite game. But not now,  coz it was better in before. I was able to write anything in the chat. but after the update,  I cant chat fully. I always have to pick . But why SO,  please solve the issue as soon as possible. Thank you."

A classic murder mystery with a unique art style. However the creators ruined the game by adding in the auto chat. Now no one will take what you say seriously because it is now impossible to explain yourself. I feel like removing auto chat or making it optional would fix all the problems that the creators have now made for themselves. Its disappointing that I cant play it with my friends because the developers ruined it completely.

Nothing helps,  and it does this with every server I join. Rating the gameplay though,  just fine. I hope my glitch goes away and I can play."
"the game is good at first but now its not,  I cant even play cuz I cant get in a lobby,  once the game started the screen went all black and all I can do is leave try try and try but still ,  fix this please"
It was a spectacular game but the new updates are making it worse I suggest going back to the old game when it comes to menu screenvoting screen as well as the phone it should remain as a tablet. It should keep the new map and perhaps add some new roles but not any changes like voting screen

"This game is great i highly reccomend it,  but I have one reccomendtation for the game the ability to sabatoge one rooms lights,  as each room would have a metal box on the wall and if that rooms lights were sabatoged,  it could be fixed by flicking the switch in the box. Overral really good game"

The reason I only gave it four stars is because its become a dating app more or less. People put their names as Hxrnygirl (or boy),  need a gf (or bf) and other gross names. The reason they dont get sensored is bc they replace letters with others resembling them. This needs a solution. Other than that,  I love the app,  love the updates,  love the tasks. "

And my phone is a new one,  a Samsung Galaxy S20. I wont give the game hate for anything else because for me at least I was able to choose my own chat setting. But I really cant play it and I wish I could."
Could be better but people are awful to play with. If you dont have a group to play with I wouldnt even play this game. Just did a public play and calling each other names and getting mad and leaving in the middle of it. Just isnt worth it.

Id really appreciate it if you could make the app compatible with all devices because I cant play on my phone due to glitching and bugs.

"Ok,  so my last review was 3 starts,  but now i change it to 5 starts. It doesnt ask me to sign in again anymore,  and the other bugs are also fixed. The app is really fun now,  also thanks for fixing the bugs. I play this game everyday and nothing annoys me anymore "
"The game was nice,  but since the update started we could not communicate with each other. Me and my friends would play but then stopped because of the quick chat. I hope they get rid of the QUICK CHAT"

It could be a way to communicate when you are not in a meeting."

"It was fun and good (except for the people that just accused and never argue). But now,  this game has become not fun anymore,  you cant chat,  so much players... Dont do this,  you had a good game,  and the luck to become famous,  dont waste it like this."

Chat box is annoying. Time consuming just to explain something. Its so bad. Really really bad. Remove the chat box that is fix with words. Let the players Chat freely. It is much faster during game

"I loved playing the game and meeting new friends while playing online during the first release Before BIG update happened... The freedom of changing names and chatting freely with others is stripped from the game,  so it has auto messages,  taking too much time to chat and rather difficult as well."

i played among us before like way before when it blew up wayback september 2020 i guess. I redownload it today again  suddenly got confused on what suddenly happened with the app. Things gets more confusing. The new update is just not it. Please bring the old among us back.

Among us is a good game but after the update personally I think its had a downturn. If you get a among us profile then its fine but some people dont know how to and this is causing uninstallings as they cant speak in chat. I do recommend but only if you get a profile )
"Among us is good,  and all,  but,  the reason I rate this app 3 stars is because,  I just cant say it. You are required to sign for in a account As guest mode,  you cant chat. I dont wanna put my email here. Really cool among us. We have a gold digger among us"

Hey among us team this game is really good. But if you update this game in advance version it would better like try to make among us form in zombie level or try to make among us which both crewmate and imposter could use weapons like guns or lightsabers. Try to bring among us in New advance updates.
"I like it but it doesnt have any chromebook support. Like the only thing I can use on a chromebook is a mouse which make it super hard to kill. But I overall like the game its pretty fun,  and I can easily get around the quick chat"

Its nice until Im constantly dropped for no reason and cant connect especially when the game starts. And I usually play with my friends so it really sucks. Add a reconnect feature
Preety good game but you should add the old chat box back so we could freely chat Because all we could say is is those words you can only say Please put the old chat back so i could give this 5. Also add a new map so i could be happy.

Just your new update ruined the game as a whole. Quick chat. 1.It disables the ability for people to speak freely and make bonds within the game. 2. The people who have free chat get annoyed because most people have quick chat and they cant really have a discussion,  and play the game. I know you guys are tryna make stuff safe and stuff. But less players are playing your game. And now even less are playing the game because of this update. Please just get smthng to replace it."
Yo among Us is a good game the reason why I gave it 2 stars is because as soon as it was finished downloading I ran into a problem that I cant talk to anyone when I was in poster for some reason they were talking and typing in Chad but I cant do either one of those so I quit trying to find out wha...Full ReviewYo among Us is a good game the reason why I gave it 2 stars is because as soon as it was finished downloading I ran into a problem that I cant talk to anyone when I was in poster for some reason they were talking and typing in Chad but I cant do either one of those so I quit trying to find out what the hell is going on and I just cant fix it but worst of all it was slow that my phone turned off and I found the reason I need to update and download special content just to do all of that.
Yeah this game is so trash now I literally tried so many times to get in but nothing this game is worse then anything the only reason I dont give it a 1 star it still is a little fun once you get in after 5000 attempts and it used to be good but now its a pile of trash nothing good the new colors ...Full ReviewYeah this game is so trash now I literally tried so many times to get in but nothing this game is worse then anything the only reason I dont give it a 1 star it still is a little fun once you get in after 5000 attempts and it used to be good but now its a pile of trash nothing good the new colors look so similar to the old ones and it is confusing some of the names of the new colors are so stupid and overall its a pain to get in a game
I wanna give this a three because its fun yes but not as fun as it used to be because one some things are difficult and we cant chat like we used to it used to be better that way I like how you could text what you want instead of having to figure out an entire sentence
"TERRIBLE Ever since the comms wheel came put the chatting is garbage Plain old censor chat works fine Plus,  everybody thinks Your just testing the chat,  and not taking what you said seriously 1 STAR"
"With each update this game gets worse. Now the frame rate is so slow i cant tell whats going on nor can i react to things properly.

This game use to be so much fun now its less of gameplay and more of struggling to get it to work."
PLEASE get rid of the you cant join another game for 10 minutes for intentionally disconnecting thing Its not fair because a lot of the time there are hackers  we leave a game because of it You cant punish us for that And also get rid of the hacking

The second thing i dont like is the username,  when we sign up there is no option to type our username but when you join they will give you a random name. Pls fix it."

I only have had a few issued with this game. 1. Theres a glitch where someone gets killed as they report another body. Then after discussion it takes us to the same stop. 2nd is people that cam camp. Imposters cant do anything if people continue to camp on cams.

So I really like this game but theres a little issue Here. 1. Theres killing and I dont like that. 2. Lots of bugs 3. (Good warning) Good graphics And Good job on making this game .

Alongside that its a great game and I really have hope in this game returning to a good state. )

From the new updates about quick chat to it lagging. This game is like Fortnite where it took out the good days. And started getting crashed this is exactly whats happening to among us. This game asks for your birth witch I personally think of a 50 year old man vibe because of this. This game has changed too much I just mine as well spend a whole week on making another more trashy than the normal among us. At least people would start having the old vibes.
I like this app and the new map airship and hats and even colors too...so i rate 5 stars but when i have a chlotes the feet are look so funny so fix it and btw you can chat but you need to sign in so veeerrry nice  but many are telling that there is a new map called submerged please add it
"This game is good and all but the thing that bugs me is the quick chat,  we should be able to write our opinion ourselves. Please remove the quick chat and bring back the normal chat please."

They removed manual chat which was one of the main mechanics that brought enjoyment to this game. Without people being able to bring there own tone and excuses the game lost so much charm. I dont know why they thought this was a good idea especially to alienate the biggest player base (mobile) for your app.

This game use to be AMAZING but know that the update is here its actually not that great. Like I love the airship and new colours but I would actually like to type my own words again and not get confused in what people are trying to say.

I Like To Die game before the update because the update kind of ruin the fun so I was thinking if we can do it after again but this time it can go to the same thing and there would be a voice chat and you wont have to join clubs or whatever it would be all for free
"The game is constantly lagging. It wasnt like this before,  but it keeps lagging now and its impossible to play sometimes. When the app decides to work,  Im already dead,  because the impostors wont wait for the game to work as you can imagine. Fix it please."
Good game but the older version was good and the new chat system is the worst in this game . It also take time to start the game. Plz fix these things . If u do this then I will rate it 5 otherwise it will be 3 or less than 3 .

I like the game. Its like playing detective style but too many immature kids on here that can be annoying. Also how if you leave a game now itll not let you play for 5 minutes needs to go.
"What happened to the old Among Us This new style,  and all the other features that everyone else is talking about are worse to be honest,  and I miss the old,  and original style,  just like the game Hopeless. Please bring the old and Original Among Us back."
This is the best game I have ever played with others here are 3 options when you choose online 1 host 2 public 3 private there are 4 options that where you have to play. This is the best multiplayer game. I will suggest you all to download it. Thanks to innersloth to invent this game

Awsome game But it got a little bit bad whem the update came. 1.) We cant choose our name. 2.) We cant write what we want to we only can choose what its says. Really really Sad about the update. Plssss fixxxx

This is the best game I have played... Amazing app and new features are awesome........ But we cant change our name We cant type.... If we have scan so we cant type...... But overall the game is nice.....
Best game. I dont know why people tell this game is no more intresting. I think they forget to switch to free chat after creating account. For me this game is best.
"The Problem The assetssprite didnt load,  and Im getting a low frame rate. I dont think im asking for much,  Innersloth. Otherwise,  this is a good game,  its that mine (and others) need to have a few tweaks to fix it Edit Problem Has been Fixed. Thank you Innersloth."
"I dont like the new version,  everything is different I cant even type freely in the chat,  everything seems complicated in the game now. The game was beast in its prime now I cant even report an imposter without the time running out and etc..."
"Cool game The only problem is the new pick type . Its so hard to use and you can barely say any important things. Not only that I think you should add more colours and at least 1 pet for free. If you are looking at this comment,  its worth installing but you might get bored after 3 or 4 rounds."

Ok now that you cant type what you want I dont like it and thats the reason I gave it 2 stars its a fun game but I hope they update it more and hopefully Ive us the chat back where we can type what we want.

Great game play it all the time. Although it does have a problem with randomly disconnecting and throwing you out of a game. Now there is a 5 minute penalty for leaving mid game. Only problem is it cant differentiate between random disconnects and voluntarily leaving. Deal breaker for me.

Its a fun game but quick chat made it so much worse. The game was a lot better when there was free chat. Will give five stars if free chat comes back. (Edit) free chat is now available so i came back and gave it five stars

I enjoyed this game a lot but It often disconnects me from the server. It doesnt matter if we playing as a guest or signed it often disconnects me. And I have A good quality of network. Please fix this issue or I might miss some exciting rooms.
Used to be a great game and played all the time with family and friends. Now I cant even get the thing to load. Ive uninstalled and reinstalled and nothing works. Beyond that not having free chat anymore or the ability to change your name sucks. Should have left it alone.

Thanks
"It was good,  UNTIL they added the new chat. IT SUCKS. First,  they take away chat. Then,  they take away the choice to name your character Like,  what next Taking away the choice for you to change settings Keep it up and the game will go from okay,  to a dead game"
"This experience was the worst I have ever had 1. They will not send you the sign in email 2. You are not able to sign in easily 3. You cant type what you want in the chat [etc] Hope the creators see this and can fix this problem,  and make the experience better for everyone"

"This game used to be so much fun but ever since the new update it kind of sucks and is very hard to understand. You have to pay to type what you want and you also have to pay to change your name.

Ok I really loved the game from the beginning and I would play a lot with my friends.... But now when I play on a public lobby instead of just using my keyboard I have to use stupid wheel thing and it takes me forever to figure it out when I do im ejected please remove the wheel PLEASE

However,  Among Us is a deception game,  and thats great,  deception games however are dependant on communication,  and the most recent Amomg Us update has ruined that aspect of the game. The chat now has preset sentences you can choose to communicate,  but these all suck. Due to the lack of options in chat,  the games are just chaos where everyone votes everyone else and the innocent cant defend themselves."
Best Game Ever. Please add a Add to Friend feature. Multiplayer. And Friends should be able to send the game code to each other. A chat box on the menu.
"Hey,  heres a great idea,  How about instead of adding in new colors and skins and maps noone asked for,  and fix the network and connection like everyone has been asking for since this God forsaken game came out"

But I think there should be something to make it better like autocensoring key words that can be seen as objectively suggestive and not for the game,  so that people can still chat but it lessens the chance of being innapropriate on it. thatd be a lot better than Quick Chat which EQUALLY ruins the game for everyone else just as much as those innapropriate people did."
I loved this game but now you cant disscus the imposter so theres nothing there by the time you try to find something to say voting is done or you can even defend yourself and explain whats going on ..not worth it anymore the chatting of who the imposter is was the whole point of the game
"This game used to be good and fun,  but then the update really messed the game up. You can no longer type in the chat. I constantly get disconnected from servers in the middle of games even though there are no problems with my internet connection. Sadly this game has gone downhill."

This game used to be so fun but now its filled with teamers and hackers . I joined a couple of games and all of them had teamers who were playing with random people and then voting them out.
"Have good memories of this game. But the new chat system makes it unplayable for me. This is a game about communication,  so why make it so difficult to communicate"

This game is really fun All though you have to pay for it.. but it was fun while it lasted D there is a lot of videos and memes about it. Alot of people enjoy it I havent downloaded it in a long time. But i might like it DDDD
I play this game every day it is a easy game well. They should take away the jumpscares Im trying to win it. I never won as the imposter yet. It seems cool but i need to learn more about among us
"Look,  Im just gonna be honest. This game has not been what it used to. I used to play this for hours,  but now i barely play. Now,  most things I had problems with were fixed in the newest update. I dont know though,  maybe the will keep adding and it will never feel the same. Thank you for listening."
"Used to be a fun game,  but now it wont even start. Can never get past the home screen. And when it did you would get into a lobby and be instantly banned for NO REASON and if you did get into a game youre just with toxic ppl,  cheaters and hackers."

The concept is cool but the new updates made the game hard to play. You can only see half the screen and if you want to say something you have to press a lot of buttons. Please fix it.

I love it but the only thing is you have removed chat because of abuse . But we cant find the words and the thing we have to write thats not good so plssssssssssss change it . I want to type the words with my finger not finding the words and sentences.

game looks good. but lacks inbuilt voice chat option. To compensate this people use other apps while playing the game to be connected in voice. obviously inbuilt voice chat option would allow us to hear only voices of characters near us. If this was supported would give 5

Would have like this game more if it wasnt for the constant you are disconnected to the server pls. Fix that it ruins my enjoyment for the game and now I hate the fact I have to log in

I love Among Us I just the reason it is at 3 stars is because of the chat I would rather have Free Chat because people get confused about what you trying to say because you cant type it yourself and because of it I would not recommend this to a friend with the chat its that annoying.

I dont like it now beacuse you have to sign in to use your own name so if u change it back to only version where we dont need to sign in this 2 star will go to a 5 star okay so since the new update I started to like it more so now its a 3 star but if u fix the things above then u get 5 stars
"I love this game its the best game too its better than all among games but I have a problem I want a pets skins hats but it cost money soon I have a idea u can make among money with assignments and make vent clean at map polis and make submerged,  make pop it too all players love pop it"
This game is fun but I hate the glitches A new glitch is that the game could not authenticate me I am still very confused about that Like...I signed into my account

Google Play Store reminded me of updates and I suddenly saw Among Us update. I read the list of Whats New.When I saw you can clean vents, I was LITERALLY BLOWN AWAYThis is one of my favourite games. Thank u and GOOD LUCK"
This game is really cool and I like it but I think there should be UNLOCKABAL hats. For example you play on the airship 10 times you should get a new hat plus an achievement. But besides that this is really good
"My problems are fixed,  typing in the chat and changing your name. Its annoying when you cant chose your own name in guest mode,  but everything else is ok."
"This is a great gameEver since the Airship came out, There were more tasks and more to exploreSadly we cant customize and write our own names anymore but this game still get a five star rate. yee"

The latest chat feature is shittt. It is completely inconvenient. Not fun at all. We are not bots to do limited communication. Get the original chat feature back.

very good game except that the movement controls are very bad because it does not work for arrow keys on the keyboard and when i go into the airship engine room is gets very lagging al of the sudden.... please fix these problems

This was a very fun game up until the latest update. Now I cant play games with my friends that have their settings to quick chat only even though my settings are set to free chat or quick chat. If I was free to play with anyone I would give 5 stars but until then its going to be 3 stars from me.
I love this game but just fix it when it load it takes much time so please fix it  It is so much fun to play it every one You should add some more colour in it Those colours are good but it needs to be more colours and with upto 20 players

"Its cool and all,  I can talk and play with my friends. I do have one complaint though,  in a newer version of the game you cant say what you want,  which makes it harder to be an imposter. I know people say inappropriate things,  but cant you just turn it into hashtags Please fix this,  thank you."
"I have played among us for a while but then decided to have a break from it,  while my break they made an update with the chat where you have options to choose from which makes it nearly imposible to talk. Id rate this a 5 stars if you fixed the chat. "

I used to love the game. But now You have to use the confusing quick chat. It makes the game impossible to communicate. You cant defend yourself in any way. Please let me type chat. It is so much easier and I will rate five stars
"I used to absolutely love this game. Now it kinda sucks. You have limited chat options,  and cant choose your name. Im giving 3 stars because its not too bad just that the new update kinda ruined it for me. I love the new colors and player amount though"

This game is so nice. I personally very much like it but only one thing I want audio chat it will be great game although. Try to give audio chat.
4 stars because its cool the new map is great and everything but the new sign in thing is not working for me when i click sign in my screen will just turn to a little bit gray pls let me if this is because of the game or not so i can fix something.

(i cant go in among us it gives errors
"I love this game,  but you really need to change the text back to normal. I will be playing it and when I try to tell them who the imposter is,  it takes me the whole time trying to tell them,  or they will think I self reported,  please change it back"
"I used to LOVE this game so much,  but then this new update came along and the main thing for me,  is that you can no longer type to people in the chat the game feels generally more rigid and less fun and capricious. I really want the old among us back please....."

After the worst update on the planet this game lost everything...i installed it again and its even worse than before. Cant even sign in my google account plus it doesnt even works. If there was 0 star option thats what id give it This game sucks
"I cant type after the airship update and it wont let me sign in, says something about a google token Also the sprites are just shown as pink blobs,  please fix this. Editworks much better now thats for fixing D"
"This game to me used to suck but now for some reason,  its fun to play. Although there are really toxic players in public matches but you cant report them and they get banned instnantly so pls fix that by making it so that you can report someone and they get banned from the match"
It is actually a great game. But I dont like it anymore. Idk why but since they updated this game. I cannot talk anything I want. And u know its quite hard ) I hope the viral one will be here once. So I can enjoy the game
"Among us is a great game. The developers are adding more detail,  more scenery,  more options,  and I absolutely cant wait for their new submerged map will come out. I also have high expectations for the new sheriff and scientist role. All in all its a great game that I absolutely recommend."

The game is quite fun but when you want to see something on your point of view and the chat its quite hard to explain what your point of you is because of the new chat you have to say certain words

This game was the best before the update I just missed the game and came back to play a little but I cant even play a single game it wont load lobbys its an absolute down fall so disappointed I dont recommend anyone to download this now
"Dissapointed with the state of this game. Your new chat is stupid and diffcult to navigate. It was so much simpler to be able to type what you want to say. Instead of having to see the options of speech. Trash experience now,  there is very little communucation."
This game is really fun but I cant play anything on here or make my own lobby IT takes forever to load and the only thing I can play on here is free play but its not that fun. I wish to play this again because I really enjoyed this game. So can you fix the problem.

The new meeting UI looks a bit tacky. Please dont make any more look and feel changes. This is not the kind of game that needs frequent updates. Keep it how it was
Ive played 100 games in a row as a crew mate I wanna be an imposter so Im missing out on half the fun they should change the algorithm so you can be the imposter at least once every 5 games you play

"The best game ever I played ,  a good strategy game ,  I like when I be the Imposter and killing crewmates is the best part ever ,  but some times because of the error the game get disconnect."
"Fun game Only thing tho they RUINED chat for anyone under 13. Thats why its 4 stars. You used to be able to type what you want but then in the update,  anyone under 13 had to chat with presets. Good thing i only had to do it for a week (i turned 13 after that week) overall fun game"
I love this app so much fun but the only problem is we cant chat by my own it is a part of new update I am giving a 4 star  bcz of that . Also I know why they add that update bcz people are chatting with inappropriate words so ya.
The game is brilliant and fun when its not spoiled by hackers. Edit make sure you keep updating to the latest version If you dont update you have access to only the limited number of games running on the old version and hackers seem to spoil those.

Can you plz let us make costom maps because I think this can Improve the game a bit so we can play in other peoples maps but they have to check if you can get to each task and vent it the game and do alot of things so yeah i think this can improve the game so I can give this 5 stars. 2. Also plz show the player color in quick chat because it takes me forever to say names I think this improves it
"when I get stuck in the black screen and im in the lobby, it gets annoying and I get mad, but dont give hate cause its trying its best to make the game fun, it took its time to create the maps so appreciate what they do bc you should never judge a book from its cover."

I LIKE THIS GAME VERY MUCH. The reason for 4 stars is the CHAT SYSTEM.I am literally frustrated from this chat system. Finding what to write takes time and the voting times gets over. Can you plz remove this system plzzzzz
I like this game. But i had a slight problem. The problem is you cannot type freely and you only need to choose. And the other is your user name changes random names. If this two problems are fix i will change my comment. Plsss fix it

Please Innersloth make the Submerged Map Update without any problem and nothing will happen to that map. So I am waiting for new Among Us.
"Unplayable on a phone. Cant sign into Google play games through this game,  therefore youre not able to play online games because of the chat lock they forced on us. Maybe the devs can work with Google and get this fixed Otherwise this is getting uninstalled yet again"
"I love this game,  but now,  im having a problem after the update. Its hard to describe your feelings,  and everytime the round starts,  its just go into the black screen for so long. I dont even know if the other players are already playing. Fix it. I dont have much time playing "

"Amazing I love the new style And Im excited for the new submerged map But in the update,  can you add the feature where instead of mini crewmates having no hats,  can you make it so they can wear the same hat as you please If so,  Id be happier Thank you for being in my life"
"I got a huge problem,  I used to like this game so much but now I cant even play it,  I go in the app it loads,  but after it shows the sloth the whole screen goes black for a long time and eventually it kicks me out I dont think its my phone Please fix it"
"First I loved very much but after update I didnt like. Features of quick chat and inbuilt names, but now I like this game as new tasks, new maps etc.... I have created an account too."
"I want to report a bug. The thing is that whenever I am imposter,  whenever I go to cockpit and check the map there.....I GET HANGED. and thats why sadly I have have to leave the game. Its very sad. I am a developer myself and I suggest to please fix this. Thank You."
I love it Awesome game I like how your friends can join you if your in the the house with you and also one thing can you just fix the lags pls its so annoying other wise best among us game ever

Its awsome the one problem is that when you make a server not one person joins. but when you join one others a lot of people. and it said that when there is one spot left. it said it was full when in reality it is not full.

Look Among us was a great game before. but u gotta Cancel the auto chat. Its annoying and its harder to vote the imposter out if like. We only have like. 23 Words U gotta bring back the Original chat update.
"I like this game. Also for the ones who hate the quick chat,  just make the year on 2000. Also,  just make your own gmail accounts. Its easy,  SO STOP PUTTING ONLY 1 STAR JUST BECAUSE OF THE QUICK CHAT. Also there are no errors for me. And I only hate the new shhhh design."
"Great game,  really fun and entertaining but the servers are very bad,  its almost impossible to play with my friends when I cant even enter a game and when I do get the chance it takes me out of the match my Internet conection is perfect and that doesnt seem to be the problem."
This game is full of cheaters and people being in chat with friends. Its so obvious when you are imp and you kill someone. Then somebody calls an emergency meeting and says they saw you even though there was nobody else around. Idiots like this have destroyed the game.

"To chat you have to use a wheel of prefab responses that make communication impossible. This has ruined the game. 1 star,  would go lower but cant."
I like the game when I played it in months back but the thing is that if young people play this and they want free chat they need help from parents but normally they not agree to do it so thats why I gave 4 stars and not 5 pls bring free chat for free.

Very fun. It would be fun if there were more new content. Mabye hide and seek mode Also sometimes there are some really mean people. But other than that its a really fun game ) BUT THEY NEED TO ADD A FRIENDING SYSTEM.

I like among us very much but this parent portal is not good but other thinks are awesome also buy and purchase money is not good. Why not give win tokens like win every match and get 5 points and then buy pets skin and more it will be awesome and pls remove parent portal. Thank you

I absolutely loved this game before but now the chat is broken it makes me feel like Im playing with bots... Can you please fix that It was a really fun game the only problem is the broken chat and the lagging I hope you understand I had alot of memories with this game (
"At first,  Among Us was amazing,  it was so much fun,  but I stopped playing after a while and when I tried to play again it signed me out of my account or something,  so,  I have no choice but to undownload this game. I am extremely dissapointed."
Ive played this game for about a year now I enjoy playing it everyday except when the update came when the chat was different I just couldnt chat probably and it is hard to chat so I give it 2 stars because I still like the game but without the chat.

This game is okay the only thing is that I cant really type MY OWN THINGS IN MY OWN WORDS. please change that But overall this game is good no ads no glitches.
This game is awesome I just with it had some new updated features like...A FRIENDING option. Please make it so we can have a friends list and invite our friends to games. I just got done playing with two brothers for four hours. Had to say goodbye and will probably never see them again. (
They fixed bugs but I still cant chat despite having an account. I assume its because im mobile but its really annoying and hard to communicate with people.
It was good before..but now I dont like it. The fact that you need to get signed in to chat and put a name of your choice bothers me.If it only could be like before..Please fix this

This game was great until the airship came. You cant type in the chat anymore and you have to randomise your name. Its also become very laggy and I often need to reconnect. Please fix this.
Its better than even the old version trust me  You get max 15 players in a match which is even more interesting. I previously gave it 1 star after being disappointed but now I am happy and satisfied ...heres a free chat option also in settings. Absolutely loved it 
Its a great game.But there is one bug.Evertime i load into a game my screen goes black.I can still play the game it just hard to see what im doing.So can you please fix this.Ik theres not alot of people working on this game.
"The game has been ruined.The chat is only letting us speak like robots. I USED to play this game every day. Now,  I hate it. PLEASE INNERSLOTH,  PLEASE let us have the old chat back and speak like normal people. The fate of Among Us rests in your hands."

I love the game but when i try to go to public it takes forever to load and i keep restarting the game but it wont work. Other than that its a pretty good game.
1. The upgrade is trash now you have to sing in to customize your name and you only talk through the words that is put for you I hope you read this and change it back to normal I think this is why people stopped playing it

I am very glad that my previous problems have been fixed but now i have a new one. I can play the game perfectly but after im 510 minutes into the game it disconnects me from the game. Then I have to join another game but i never get to finish one. Please fix
I loved this game but because of the new update of the chat commands I dont like it it is so hard to accuse someone in a game cause you have find there name I get that the game is trying to be family friendly because some people cruse but please bring the free chat back.
At first this game was awesome now everyone got bored i think that u should allow people to use mods and mods can make the game a little bit better or I have another point that you can make more modes and u might get full ratings and im giving you two stars because I even got bored.

I used to like this game a lot until you added this typing update it is really annoying because when I see someone kill another person hardly anyone believes me because on the new chat thing there is no easy way to say that and it makes me rage quit sometimes please remove it.
It was a good game but after update it became very bad. It became difficult to chat with others. Many players plays this and talk with each other through discord. Plz find a solution for this. Thank u

Ordinarily this is a good game but now its just.. not. Charging 50 cents or asking creditssn details just to verify an account is ridiculous. And the fact I cant even play with my sibling due to incorrect chat mode on gameslobbies.

The game now asks for you to make an account which you then have to download another stupid app. You cant have custom names and you cant freely type anything its a ping system now which is counterproductive to the discussion portion of the game. People just call emergency meetings every second and vote random people off because theyre not fast enought to input anything through the ping system.
This is stupid. I used to like the game but now i cant even play. When i try to join a public game it just loads and will load forever. When i try joining any private game same thing happens. When i try creating a game what you know same thing happens. 1 star until i can ACTUALLY play the game

I think that its a good game. the only thing that I dont like is one of the newest updates you can no longer chat with people theres only a few responses that you can pick from.

I also dont like all of these freaky names that theyre picking for people you dont get to choose your own name anymore. I prefer how the game originally was when I first started playing a year ago.
I love it But the reason I put 3 stars is because I hate the account update. I know its to protect children and stuff but the usernames You can cencore inappropriate usernames and chats.
"Very good game but needs to let people add there friend on and tell when they are online,  this may be a upcoming update but I just want it,  I want to add my friends and play games with them."

"Yeah, I dont fully hate this game after all Im getting used to quick chat.but I still miss the old free chat. my friends wont play anymore but I think I stay to this game.also, I want a free pet"
One the new account system is horrible plus the new chat function where you have to have an account to talk but if you dont you have to search for it. 15 would not recommend playing unless a change is made 
A amazing game  People think its the worst now but in my opinion its the best In December 2020 People are thinking you are going to release the airship on December 10 but then did not release and on February they were thinking it was on Valentines but it shifted to March 31 but I know the reason...Full ReviewA amazing game  People think its the worst now but in my opinion its the best In December 2020 People are thinking you are going to release the airship on December 10 but then did not release and on February they were thinking it was on Valentines but it shifted to March 31 but I know the reason why cause it was a long map even puffballs (think I spelled it wrong) told us this map is big then polus . Every big map takes a lot of time. Maybe Im saying a lot but definitely a five star
I absolutly love this game i play it everyday but for some reason lately theres been alot of disconnection errors and my wifi works perfectly fine on any other app so i need to know whats going on and idk if its just cause the rooms i join dont last due to this disconnecting error

And this was very called for. I deleted among us a long while ago and now decided to revisit on of my favorite games. And I was horrified by the new update. When I was renavagating the game I couldnt help but keep thinking Is this a rip off game or a new update I was disappointed to realized they actually changed everything. You cant even talk in the chat anymore. If they wanted less cussing then they shouldve censored it. Ugh.

"Its a very nice game,  I even gave a 5star to it. I only want one thing in this game,  i.e an offline mode. Apart from that,  no changes required. Good to play this game,  no violence,  just only forcing others that you are right. Keep it up"
The game was great until the update. It limited you ability of speech and made the game harder to play. It also made it less fun. I liked the older version better when it was fun and more playable
I love the game its fun but I have just gotten an glitch that makes it so that I cant sign in and have to play as a guest kind dumb. Please fix this soon.
"Among us used to be a really fun game,  now its all robotic and oretty much useless because you cant type in the chat to explain yourself,  you can only use the robotic default chats. Among us has gone down hill."

I cannot get the imp every single time when I play this game But this is pretty much a fun game"
"With the amount of players in this game,  I am surprised to see that the rating is so low. Ive played well over 1k games and can say I am addicted. My only complaint are the hackers and the kids who have turned it into a dating app. But neither of those are the developers fault."
"The game was really fun,  WAS. After the new update it all went downhill. I understand that its for to avoid innapropriate things BUT then again. The fun is gone. It would be really nicemto bring back the old among us."
"This game sucks,  in this game whenever I try to play a game if started chatting and doing it for long time then the room closes due to inactivity. Like it is just closing the room if not starting soon. I hate this. The people dont even join the room fast so that we can at least start the game."
My extreme favourite. The only online game I play is among us is like suuuuuuuper my favourite but sometimes it gives me a problem to reload it again which is no harm to me because its my favourite. I always play among us online with family and friends and itsssss just like........... AMAZING .
I love it for its originality. You dont see many games like this ever. Its the appreciation of something new that really captures me about this game. EDIT The new update completely ruined the experience. The auto chat is stupid they need to get rid of it. All it does is make you more sus

I would give this a 5 star rating because I love the game but as host Ive found multiple ppl cheating and when you go to remove them from the game it says that they have already left but there still clearly standing Infront of me I even have photos of the proof.
much better its good and please fix the one when you play as crewmate and imposter in the airship its lacking to move around and it takes a little long to load up the game and also the start of the game its glitchy.

With the new update it harder to play with friends if they dont have a account or can get one because I like free words. Before the new update it was good though. )

They did not listen to their audience. I mean yes,  they added a new map  increased the no. of players. However,  they removed freedom of speech. Selecting what to say is so hard especially when youre trying to accuse someone. Like you have to remember the names (cause thats the only selection) instead of just saying the color. Its boring. Bring back the chat then Ill surely play this game again."

I waited so long but it did nothing. Please fix this. The game is great,  I loved it,  thats why I rate it five stars."
It was a great game but now no matter Im logged in or not when I touch play online it shows the 3 dots ... for endless time and when I click create game it shows a black screen and never changes.
Great game. But one thing. Next update let us choose are name and have text chat optional without an account. I wouldve done five stars. But great game
"The fact that you have to put part of your ssc,  and put your zip code to access some parts of the game is absolutely RIDICULOUS. The game in my opinion,  is really good but that part is a HUGE turnoff."

But dont get me wrong i still love the game and i see whare the creator is going with idea of the game it just need improvement
When the game starts it does not appear on the screen. Like why I just wanted to play but when I pick a roomserver and the game starts it would take more than 5 minutes to load and I dont even get to play. Its just black screen and like a popping sound I think.
Might wanna add a username thing... I see horniboy And all Verizons when I look for severs...... And a friending system would be nice And if you could move the  room inactivity time to a hour for when we dont have enough players to start

There is problems with the servers they is start to collapse and I suddenly get disconnected sometimes not only me I think that happens to some other players too because they start to disconnect one by one

The new updates they did are horrible (in my opinion)you cant chat properly and if you do chat it takes longer plus when I tried playing with my friends I couldnt play with them because of a update. I got this game to have fun and to play with friends I cant do either now.

I love this game but whenever the game starts I just gets disconnected and it says that an unknown error disconnected you from the server maybe there is a bug in this game idk if this is happening with not just only me
"As l want to gave 5Stars but I dont like chat pls keep the chat as old one. That is better than the new one . Anyways,  this game is soooo awesome,  exiting etc etc etc.. I love this game"
I used to love this game but now there are new updates and its made this game unenjoyable. Im completely frustrated and I keep having problems signing in. Please please change it back to how it was.
This game is so addicting And never gets boring. But i wish there was an add friend option....i met wonderful and silly people i wish i could be friends with. The game started getting less fun when some players starting hacking and teaming up
This game was great but when you added the quick chat feature it went from good to bad. The fact that you need your guardian to open free chat is just sad because now we can talk with our friends so please make it optional without needing to have your guardian open it you.
"This is a great app,  but ever since the update the chat is to complex and its hard to describe your point if you can only type specific words. But overall its a good game...pls bring the old chat back. Thank you."
"Mostly a good game its fun,  I like the art style,  but it wont let me make a account and because of that I can only 7se quick chat. You just cant speak freely anymore so thats why I gave it four stars otherwise its a fun game."
The best game ever i am a littel disappointed with that it does not work on ipad if you go to the website and play you can choose what you want to be an imposter or crewmate you have pets and skin and more hats and you dont need to pay
"Has had many great updates to make the game better and have smoother transitions. And (for me) it hardly lags in the game. Also,  maybe it wasnt such a good idea for them to remove free chat but I still enjoy the game most of the time"
I used to like this game so much and the update isnt bad but the fact that you can only use quick chat to communicate in meetings is so stupid its a good concept but the way it was delivered ruined the game for me.I hope you fix this problem.

"This is an example of a dev killing their own game. The chat was an important element in this kind of game. Limiting it to only a few option is,  if I were to put it kindly,  foolish."

"I really miss the old version,  with the chat now different and going through loops to change my user,  its just not fun anymore. I cant say the things I need or want to in chat and its gotten boring. I cant play what the point of the game was too. "

"This is a good game,  but you took away the most important thing to find the imposter,  and that is the CHAT,  you need the chart to say who is the imposter,  of you guys do not do something we will,  and I mean all of us will uninstall,  besides that the game is great."

"Its a great game. You read a lot of peolple complaining about needing to sign in to play,  but this is a good thing. It has allowed the devs to crack down on spam bots and has over all made the game a better place."
I personally like among us its a good game but i dont like the new update as much because it is super hard to talk freely but you could do a log in from google play for you could talk freely i have been trying to get my dad to log in but overall i would recommend it.

"I like this game but there are many hackers in this game who always make the game boring. One more problem is some players always cheat with thier friends ,  crewmates also support imposters . Last problem is some players keep abusing in thier language with english script and bann everyone."

"I used to love this game until the update,  I respect the decision and the reason why... But the chat is hard to use in the small amount of time given. You cant finish a sentence to back you up and your fellow imposters or cremated. But I still love the suspense."
It is the best game there is no adds and you can play with your friends I definitely recommended this game to any age or kid. I said that last year now I rate it one star the update is horrible and there was no reason to do it it was fine the way it was

I would like to be able to use the regular chat. Once I am able to do that I will give this game a five star rating. I cant ask some of the questions I NEED to or tell people where I am. Fix this and I fix the rating. Edit It has been fixed As promised your five stars Thanks
This game is awesome but one slight criticism is that some servers kick you off because youre not named deku for example. The reason I think they do this is because people are roleplaying on these servers but its not the developers fault so that doesnt hurt my score.

This game used to be fun in 2020. But now it sucks. I hate how you have to use the automatic text where it picks what you get to type. Its not fun random people I get into servers in dont even type anymore they just vote and skip this game is horrible.

At first i like this game u can type anything you want but then one day they said they wanted to update a new map and then when starts that i cannot type i need to choose the words that has been given so its not fun
I love this game its just I really dont like the fact that Im not able to chat the way I used to I try to find the right word but I cant in time and then people think Im sus and I get voted out Its very annoying and I hope it changes one day
"I like the game a lot,  like with the new map and everything. But i dont like the chat. I would rather have it either be voice chat or the normal chat we had before. And it would be nice if you could do free pets and stuff like that. If you can do this thanks,  if not its fine."

And even contains a lots of bugs even after theupdate but I would say the older version was fun
i like the game but the account thing i hate it why when you playing as gest you cant make your own name you cant us chat you only use speed chat its unfair this is why i deleted among us ok. i have two options for you make it fair or delete the account thing or whatever its called
"I really love this game but i cant play it anymore. Everytime when my Guardian looks at their EMails,  there is no EMail from Among Us or from the developer,  even if I send the EMail for like 5 times,  it still doesnt work."
"The game has died since last major update. 15 player lobbies only suit the Airship map,  new colours too similar to other colours so gets confusing,  reporting or meetings takes longer to get to the chat which is frustrating and players have dropped off more and we get a lot of simping.

Hope you fix this problem but all and all its a pretty fun game just this little bits makes it hard for me to find it fun nowadays.
This game was fun until the new update where I cant chat with others with my words. It gets hard to find the options and it isnt friendly at all.
Been playing this game for a really long time but the new update is AWFUL idk what they were thinking to update the game like this I hate it would give zero stars its not fun anymore like before. We used to make friends but now we cant even talk  hate it now..
The game has gotten worse over time you cant do anything with your character You cant chose your name or even type what you want and you have to put in your email to do so its just getting worse and worse
"The automated responses are really irritating now. Use to be a good game with a fun concept,  however I believe the developers have ruined it a bit. Airship map is also quite glitchy. Edit Changed from two stars to four. Thanks for bringing back manual communication"
"before I liked it but now we cant use our own nicknames or write in the chat as before,  we have to assemble a sentence to be able to communicate Before,  it was a pleasure to play but now it sucks"

I love the game but its just trash because among us was free but the names and chat was money it doesnt make sense so If I were u I would change it to free its not fair for your child or teen or adult some ppl dont want to pay money for it. I recommend if u change it I still love the game....
I have a suggestion to you so if there be a hide and seek mode in among us It does be a great game ever so there should be added 2 options on starting of opening of app weather play a free mode or hide and seek mode in hide and seek mode there should there be reveled of imposter to all the crewmates...Full ReviewI have a suggestion to you so if there be a hide and seek mode in among us It does be a great game ever so there should be added 2 options on starting of opening of app weather play a free mode or hide and seek mode in hide and seek mode there should there be reveled of imposter to all the crewmates and also meetings should be disabled dont mind weather that was a emergency meeting or a normal meeting meeting option should be disabled on the hide and seek mode it will be the best game
One of the good games has now made a big mistake adding quick chat is the worst ever update that is the main reason that players are not playing anymore so remove it then i will change the star aswell from ur first ever players

It used to be a fun game but the account system and the chat system ruined it all Like we cant even chat anymore this ruins the communication and its not as fun as it used to be anymore...please do fix it
I really miss the time when we could choose whatever name and discuss whatever we like while Playing the game.It was a good way to connect with people. But now its a stupid game even kids wont play. Give back our old Among us. PLEASE

Ofc its a great game but the reason I put 4 stars was because I like to chat..so I dont like how you cant say what you want to say in the new update so if theres anyway to Fix that Maybe you could

"Few years ago,  I really enjoyed the game. But now,  most of the time it gives crewmate to me. I dont like it very much. Even if I play 510 times without a break,  it only gives me crewmate. Besides this,  I really enjoy the game. If it werent for this problem I would have given it a 5 star"

"I loveed this game alot.. But the only problem is the chat. We cant clear ourselves when some one accuses us.. Chatting freely can make it better. If we sign in to chat freely,  there are a lot of hackers in the lobby."
The game was really fun to play with friends but since the new update were you cant talk as freely as we used to be able to talk has been a let down.It has become more difficult to communicate and talk with to other crewmats so that make it even more difficult to explain thing in meetings.

"It is a good game but has a lot of hackers,  i know you cant do much about this but i ruins the game play for me,  besides this i think it is a pretty good game which can get really suspencful at times."
Really you all should remove the quick chat in the game. Its not easy to accuse. It isnt fun like it used to be. At least restrict bad languages instead of quick chat
"This game is cool so I rate it 5 stars But.. they need to add a friend list,  including the ability to add friends to play with them again. Please add this for the next update "
You need to fix the chat it has ruined the game what made you think the limited and I mean LIMITED Chat would be a good idea Im not playing this game till the chat is back to normal and you know what I mean by that the original chat is better

We cant type anything anymore. Literally dog water game. This game was good Now we cannot type properly it sucks I am never playing this again. They changed the chat back to what it was and then changed it back again useless

It a good game but its quite complicated and kinda confusing at the same time and you cant type in the game it kinda already has it for you and why do i need to put my age whats great about it has more colors and you can have more people

"It got pretty popular at some point. Its continuously being updated as of today,  and seems to have more planned for it. Overall,  great game to play with friends,  but random lobbies can be kinda fun too. Unless there are toxic 9 year olds."
"the only thing missing from this game is the voice chat,  i means its really hectic to type and you get very little time to discuss it while typing,  you cant even connect discord while playing with randoms,  bring the voice chat for the next update,  and the game will be next level, "
It was a fun game but when the new update happened it became boring the chat is now horrible even if u needa sign in theres a wierd error where u cant so u might need to just turn the chat back to normal plzzz i think this will bring the playerbase blowing

The game is awesome no adds but change the darn chat please. It makes it a lot harder then before so please change the chat inner sloth. This comment is no hate to the game but please change it for the among us community. Love the game love the new map thanks. Ps keep up the good work.
Its fine. Sometimes tho it just kicks me out And I can not get back in then it glitches me out. That only happens when I updated it. The before version was totally better. But I like this model and all the things that we are able to do )
"Love this game. The most recent update made it impossible for me to ban or kick people. I try to ban all of the idiots,  hackers,  cheaters,  and racists,  but I cant play clean lobbies anymore. Hope this is fixed soon,  keep up the good ideas."
This game is just to laggy but at first It wasnt so laggy so the experiences I had with the lag was i spawned in a place and then it just told me my role right after and I just get disconnected alot playing this has been a PAIN in 2021

I love the game but I hate the update because after the update for some reason my screen keeps turning partially black and I cant see the other characters. This makes it difficult to be the imposter. Please try to fix this as its quite annoying.

"This game used to be really fun to play,  but the quick chat feature really downgraded the experience. Its hard to communicate with other players and even more difficult to understand who to vote for. If this was changed,  this review would be better. Thank you for your time."

Among Us is a (AMAZING) game accept for the chat in 2021 the chat you cannot even type You have to press a button and i just personly dont like it its annoying but anyways... I hope the devolper sees this and i hope it was very useful for you guys
This is the best game I have ever played It is fun and cool but I hate the update I wish you could use the chat regularly and I wish it would go back to normal because it is impossible to chat on there and not everyone does not want to sign up for a free chat
The game is fun I love the new colors and place but the rest just kinda sucks and makes me not wanna play like when you have to wait 4min when you lean I was on. The phone with my mom and it didnt let me back in until after 4min and it can get boring sometimes .
I used to love this app but the new update just ruined it for me because it is SO hard to type and you can only type specific things also I wish we could choose are own names like I know that it is not a really big deal but it was better when we could.

Its really fun and the update is super cool. But it gets really glitchy sometimes and it takes me forever to get into a game. But its pretty fun overall
great game so far Ive been playing for a while and has never got board of it I strongly recommend the game if your the online type person who loves murder games but its a small Jelly bean that can be an Inposter or an crew mate As I call it lol (its not a jelly bean) Anyways moving on Among us is ...Full Reviewgreat game so far Ive been playing for a while and has never got board of it I strongly recommend the game if your the online type person who loves murder games but its a small Jelly bean that can be an Inposter or an crew mate As I call it lol (its not a jelly bean) Anyways moving on Among us is great fun and The henry stick man map is amazing yet Im sad they took the wolf ears away from the hats selection I loved thoughz But yeah hopefully this helped Ill update this in 2022 Cya soon 
The new chat option is soo freaking annoying Remove them immediately Literally no one asked for the new chat update. I cant say anything i want because of the chat Fix this

Really fun game easy to play but the players are annoying you cant try and prove yourself innocent they will just vote even if there is no evidence that your the imposter and there is alot of lag now

Finally,  relief. The amount of 1 star reviews shows how many of these idiotic randoms existed. Good thing they are having pain."
"Found out the main reason why I cant type or response to chat. You must sign in or have an account for that. Dev,  I prefer unrestricted chat. Not simplify chat. I lost one game because of that. But I enjoy the game none the less."

"The anonymous part of this game is what made it so great when it blew up,  I see no point in having an account and not being able to type in chat. The call outs have definitely removed the fun factor of this game. This game has gone down hill so much and its a disappointment."

"Its a fun game,  but gets boring after a little bit. Its annoying whenever you join someone elses server and it takes forever for the game to start. Most of my time playing this game was waiting for the game to start."
"This game is good But..The update is a very big problem, First you cant chat by yourself, Second Players randomly Vote you when other players Believe The player that said to you..this is bad BRING BACK THE CHAT NOW"
Terrible. I cant even say what I want to. The old version was so much better than this. I cant remember the last time I said red sus. Not recoded for any one who doesnt want to sign in. You just blew your chance of getting 5 star
"I uninstalled when there was a light glitch,  and today I tried redownloading,  and they ruined it. You cant name yourself without an account,  you cant turn off quickchat,  and you cant have fun. I hate it."
It is a pretty good and very fun but I personally dont like the chatting because we dont get to text what we want but thats okay and please please please put a new role like a reviver or add new suits and it deserves 4 stars because no adds i love this game I recommend

This game is not all that great anymore it used to he fun first of all you cant even type your own name in anymore instead it randomized it with a bunch of boring names. And you wont be able to play for 5 minutes if your connection gets weak for a couple of times

"Was amazing,  new limited text options are so trash,  there is so much stuff you cant say,  its so much slower,  completely ruins gameplay in my opinion."

Game was ruined by chat. Just why though. The whole point of the game is to communicate with others and find out. Now you cant even communicate properly.

Really nice game but maybe you should give option for searching up the name of a particular room so that it would be easy for us to join our friends room.
"I love this app But,  please make more stuff free. Mostly things cost money and its not fair ( Other then that,  great"
"Really Great game but reason for 4 stars is the free chat,  i really miss free chat cuz i cant explain bc the thing i want to say is not a option. Thank you"
This game wasnt so bad and was actually quite fun but then the update of the chat system ruined it for me so can you please make it optional to choose that kind of chat and put the normal one in That would make the game much better.
Its been a while since I played among us and it has changed theres more colors and the limit of players has changed before  10 now  15 and it still doesnt have jumping. But its soooooo good play it.
I played the game before the airship and the game was more popular then but more trolls and hackers though I havent seen one. this is a great game make sure to play in a good lobby and have fun with the team you know.
I used to love this game until the update where you have to decide if You want free chat or quick chat. I didnt know what free chat means. So now i cant change it but i still like the game.
"After they put so many unnessery updates in the game you mostly disconnect from the server,  my mobile has no problem or my mobile isnt old or my internet is not slow still it happens all the time"

Its great  I just wanna mention that there WAS a feature where you can go back to the previous lobby you entered just by tapping ONLY the arrow button where you put the code. Its not there anymore. Pls put it back.

"After update (in which they changed the viewarea of vision of player) everything looks too small. I have 5.5 inch screen. Before update it was zoomed to player,  when i run ( gameplay). Now the view is standard and too much zoomed out. I wish an option to bring zoom back  was present"
awesome it is so goo and also the only bad part that you cant pick your name and color good part is that you can put dashes on cuss words if your a kid so that is plus i like that it teaches kids to help do chores and have fun
"Was a 5 star until the update. Communication is so obnoxious now and not worth playing. Not to mention connection issues,  havent been allowed to play a game in weeks because I get forcibly disconnected."

I give this game 1 star because ever since the game update. It took me soo long find a room and when I created a room then tap start the screen when black after. Please fix this
I cannot log in. Everytime i try my game freezes and the screen goes dark. I have uninstalled it re installed it. Ive restarted my tablet. Nothing works. Even after the update.

"the new updates suck. its easier to just type in chat,  no whatever they got going on right now. you cant edit your own settings. everything just sucks now and I wish they would change it back"

I loved this game until the new update. We just wanted new colors not a hole new update. you cant even say anything and no one even talks in the new update they just vote. The new account stuff also ruined the game you cant even type your own name it picks it for you. Plz change it back .

"Super fun. It can be tense at times,  but still fun. Also,  game play depends entirely on other players and experience if different with each group. This can be controlled by playing private or local games."

"This game is fun but being a crewmate is not great. Its the opposite of being an imposter,  there is less stuff to do,  and its not as exiting. If I were to change anything,  I would make being a crewmate more enjoyable"
This game is brilliant but I only rated it 2 stars because of one bug. When somebody finds a dead body it just keeps saying it over and over. Ill rate this 5 stars once this bug has gone.
"Im giving this 4 stars because whenever I quit a lot of time it tells me to wait and I dont want that otherwise 5 UPDATE MESSAGE it used to be a fun game but now its boring and what u all do is lie,  kill and boring stuff nothing very ordinary unlike SUPERCELL,  now worser because of chat, "

"A very happy game but the think is the quick chat rune the game. And it is upgraded many thinks like colours , hats and player numbers best time pass game and it makes u feel happy I loved the game"
Honestly idk why people hate this app so much. It is a great game and in my opinion there are 2 ways to improve it. Add the option to add someone as a friend and let ghosts do something interesting cause most of people when they die they leave the game.

"It was a fun game to start off with,  but then little kids starting playing and it made the chat annoying. Also it is basically online dating at this point."
The game is amazing I like the 15 player lobby more colours and four maps the thing I dont like is quickchat you cant type anything you want there are just options which ruins the game.
"This was once a really fun game,  now the chat is broken and I cant even make an account to play the game because of glitches. This game is becoming disappointing,  even with the toxicity of the community."

Decent overall game that got ruined by the implementation of the so called quick responses and the removal of being able to write.

"This is the best game ever,  but there is a problem I tried to start the game 3 times and it always just shut down itself. Please fix this"
Communication is the biggest part of this game and they made it purposefully difficult to communicate unless you make an account with them. The game was much better when it was completely open and no accounts were required.

This game is a fun way to connect with people around the world and also your friends and family P.s. If your new to the game then you need to make an account and go to settings in order for the chat update to be fixed for you
"It is much better with 15 players. New colours had arised,  including Tan. I still do not like the quick chat,  as it was impossible to say words to eject impostors. This game had spreaded to many infamous games like impostor or impostor vs crew. Although its like that,  Innersloth,  U did a great job."
It is a fun game that I would want to play for the rest of my life. The only flaw the game has is that you gotta pay money to get some items. I feel like that wasnt really a good idea on Innersloths side of the game creation.
"This was my favorite game,  but since I cant play is kinda sad. I try to find or host a game but is just searching for tooo long,  please if you could fix it I will be so grateful."
"This game was better, Im an adult and when I try to sign in it said there is a bug...and the worst of it all I cant text. The chat system is not so affective, its not fast. Edit 1 The Account Glitch, was fixed I guess.i Wich for a new map."
"Love the game but i hate it when for the 20 round and im still not imposter. Also,  please bring back free chat Its impossable to find words quickly. Other players see this as sus and you get ejected 9 times out of 10. Other than bubble chat SUCKING its a really good game."

"Its a great game,  i love doing task and voting everyone out. But the random choice for 0imposter is not as random as they say. I have been imposter twice and have played around 50 games. But when my friends play the can get imposter up to 2 or 3 time in a row.(("

It was great earlier in the year but now it just doesnt even work because I try to play a game but it never loads and the game just is so boring with this new quick chat.

Well overall the game is awesome I love it however however it is a shame that every time I play the game it says that this version is not available I dont know if its my phone own or something Im on a Samsung Galaxy A7 so that might be the issue but I hope I can play it soon
"I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH But theres one issue keeping me away from the game now.. when I try signing in to my Google play account it says error,  And theres nothing wrong with it Please fix this it was happening with my Lil sis too"
"What happened to this game I took a break from it 3 or 4 months ago. After coming back today,  the ingame chat is replaced with a quick chat option who asked for that Im removing this from my phone."
At least give us the ability to change the button layout the way it currently is I can hardly play not to mention the tap controls suck I absolutely will not give a better score unless I can change the button layout to were Its not uncomfortable when holding my phone fix the button layout.
I could barely play it kept kicking me out of the game and saying sent 6 pings that remote has not responded to it wont stop doing it and it is quite annoying please fix this
Hey InnerSloth I think I have a great idea for among us Why dont you make those characters change colourscolors while scanning then when its done scanning they return to their original look
Im really happy because the free chat is finally back ) but idk the updated version lags a lot and sometimes it stops working when its time to show that youre a crewmate or imposter and when the game starts I cant even move to go to do my tasks ..plz fix this ))
"Not very bad Everything running perfectly but unfortunately most common that i hate is always got disconnected by itself in middle game or the end of the game,  i almost got impostor down but it went disconnected"
I love this game and I love the way you look but make a new map and then make pets and all hats free then and only then I will think about 5 stars

"Keeps getting stuck. Downloading additional assets with a progress bar that wont move is as far as Ive managed to get. I wanted to play a game,  not diagnose IT issues,  but here I am hours later,  trying a fifteenth time."
Its a good game the only thing bad about it is I am forced to use quick chat and I cant type anything I would say if that changes I will give it 5 stars instead of 4. ok now its 5 star because I can say what I want
"I used to love this game so much,  but the new update just killed the joy. What used to make the game beautiful is the chat feature,  but with its cancellation,  the game became very boring and lost the interactivity that was in it. I hope the game will return to how it was."
"Update that killed chat killed this game. No more tricking,  lying,  betraying,  or baiting. Was a really cool game. Now it is more random than ever. Had for a year or two,  unininstalling. Bleh and meh."

So if there are 3 impostors in a game and 1 is voted out and one of the impostors leave so it shows that 0 impostors remain. But still there would be a impostor. Till the last update this wasnt happening.. Please understand and do the needful....
Due to the last 34 updates I can no longer play the game it will open but it keeps saying it cant be acked in do many seconds dont know what that error message means but that is what keeps showing up. I just really wish I could play the game again (

Really loved the game until the update. You cant type what you want to type and choosing what you want to say is time consuming as you have to click in the specific categories. It isnt really convenient because we have limited time to discuss.
"the game has become rlly boring because of the updates,  i used to enjoy it but not rlly anymore,  it sucks i cant even type my own message for some reason and it said that blackscreens were fixed but i still get them,  also you gotta sign up which is kinda sucks,  i rlly want the old among us back"
"Ever since the lastest update,  there has been a lot of issues. Every time when someone is very bad when I host a game,  I cant kick or ban them. A lot of people are having this issue. Please fix this"
"Finely the account stuff works and the game has its charm and heart back it 100 more fun already good game, (edit) a new update came the vent task is cool the new colors are cool but some are little hard to remember theres like three versions of pink pretty good game,  wish people actually change th...Full ReviewFinely the account stuff works and the game has its charm and heart back it 100 more fun already good game, (edit) a new update came the vent task is cool the new colors are cool but some are little hard to remember theres like three versions of pink pretty good game,  wish people actually change their review"

Updates are getting worse. Cant even type now. Freeze at the table after a vote. Bit unplayable at the minute. Gonna uninstall must make money off pc users or something. Its so bad without the normal chat
"I really like the gameplay,  but I dont like the new way you have to sign in. So can you please change it back to the old way. Thank you."
"Its suck. I cant join any group. It always says full even though it is still not full yet. I even cant text any messages. I thought it was my connection,  but i can play any other games smoothly..... So disappointed... Lol"
"This game had a problem with signing in and it was fixed but now the problem is happening again. I was really looking forward to playing this game so please fix the problem. That is all. Your among us loving fan ,  Hayley"
"Amazing game I love it so much the tasks,  Crewmates,  Imposters. You may not belive me but sometimes being a crewmate is fun. Now dont get me wrong I love being a imposter too. But the tasks are amazing. If the creator who made Among us. You did a great job keep up the great work"

I cant see the game like there is a dot in the middle of the screen and I can only see my colour but the whole screen us black and I cant see rooms not tasks.....idk what has happened to it....also people are idiot in the game like you saw someone kill a person but hey will vote u bloody fools
Cant chat. Redownloaded to see if you had changed it. You didnt still getting one star and youve still lost a player.
Well I heard this how update in among us (airship map) I know its cool but when I played it it doesnt let you change your name but when you also start playing it it said that you have to do like a email or something to change your name and to be able to text and chat to other people and I dont li...Full ReviewWell I heard this how update in among us (airship map) I know its cool but when I played it it doesnt let you change your name but when you also start playing it it said that you have to do like a email or something to change your name and to be able to text and chat to other people and I dont like that and it even doesnt let me play in a minute so I give ita 35 so yeah byeh
"I rated 1 Star because whenever I try to enter a group I cannot see the game. It keeps on running behind a black screen. Why is that And also,  the Additional Assets cost too much time to download. I missed the old version. Ugh."
Its a good and fun game just the amount of hackers is getting out of hand and I dont mean mods proper haks anyway apart from that it is amazing I love that is the only problemm but its a big 1
"Great game but I always got a message saying I have 6 pings. No idea what it means,  but when that happened,  I couldnt play."

"I am so glad that you made it to free or quick chat like the switch. And the new colors Its just like how it was before,  which is awesome except with more colors lol. And the account system works MUCH better now Well done,  Innersloth. Thanks for making my life better again."
Some of the new settings are good like you get to choose more colors and add alot of people in the game and some of them are bad like saying a limited amount of words.i tried playing today and it took forever to load and it really adjitated me very badly.
"I always used to play this game but,  now I CANT I LITERALLY CANT ITS A BLACK SCREEN THERES LITERALLY NOTHING EXCEPT A BLACK SCREEN EVERYTIME THE GAME STARTS. Pls fix it ((( If you do ill raise my 1 star to 5 stars"

"It is a good game when it release,  but now it became bad. Now you cant type to communicate and it is hard to communicate. I am disappointing."
This game is awasom but I thank there a few problems I dont thank its a good idea to put your account on among us because of the hakers and could you please set it where you can play it off line and I thank it would be better if the dummy move around Im giving 3 stars for now dut if you can make ...Full ReviewThis game is awasom but I thank there a few problems I dont thank its a good idea to put your account on among us because of the hakers and could you please set it where you can play it off line and I thank it would be better if the dummy move around Im giving 3 stars for now dut if you can make this update you may get more reviewers and I will bump my 3 stars to a five stars rating so pleas do this

It was a very good game until the chat update came. I couldnt sign in so I had to still use th chat filter. I do not play it anymore because of it. Overall it is a fun game but the chat update is annoying.
"This is a good game but the new update has been kinda of a weird thing because new colors we cant tell what they call them,  and lag,  but all other views are good airship is a nice new place in among us to people."

I have played this game so many times and I really love it. Especially when we have to discover who the imposter is using our inside resources. I feel like that makes it a learning game at the same time and its perfect for kids. They are learning and playing at the same time.
"So,  sometimes my screen turns black whenever I join a lobby or host a game,  and I cannot play anything but local,  but otherwise,  great game."
"Awesome game,  although there should be a nongory deaths switch to where I can turn off blood and stuff. Other than that its a great game"

Great game when it works. Trying to play with friends over a video call and I get kicked out with the six pings issue literally 75 of the time. I hardly ever get to complete a game now. Incredibly painful.
Its good but the older version is much better the chat is the best part of this game and you guys remove it. Its feels like Im talking to a robot Im giving it 3 star cause this is once my favorite game
"I love the game so much. But the only problem is that when u r trying to find a server there are ones that r 410 or other servers that are not full,  and it says the room is full. Then u have to find another game and it keeps on happening."
Awesome game but there is a problem  you should make a way to play with your friends yes you can join in private lobby using code seeing the code and then telling to friends would take time and when you come back it says you ware disconnected from server and this is annoying
"I love this game so much,  but I dont like the new air ship mao. Im pretty sure everyone who plays among us would agree. I use to play this like for 2 hours,  but now I only play for 15 minutes ( also thanks for bringing back free chat"

"Its is a very cool mindblowing games. I am playing this game from last one year, I always loved. It is a big boom in a small size. Nice game."
Only problem am I giving you 4 stars is we cant freely chat in guest account sometimes I will ejected because I cant tell them what happened. Orlese this is the best game I have ever played

"Hello,  help me pls Im trying to sign into my account and all it does is make my screen darker and stays there for mins, it sometimes freezes my game and I have to close the game and open it back up. Pls help me.  For that I will give it a 3 stars since it was good until this."
Really really bad game all in all the controls suck the communication system is horrible its hard for me to enter and play a good match without people leaving and messing game up
"Its good game but the chat became bad since the chat message was changed,  the game has become quiet and I can no longer chat randomly I will not play any more the first version is very good game until the game changed it was no longer as fun as before im disappointed"
Great game. I play among us on my computer and it is great but it got a little boring after awhile. This recreates the mesmerized feeling I had when I first played it.
This game is great but when i am going to find out if im an inpostor or crewmate its stays at a black screen for a long time and sometimes i get kicked out because its takes a long time. Please try to fix this bug.
I really have fun with this game The only thing is that its hard to discuss who the imposter is and I would like to be able to choose my own name. It used to be cupcake but now its choosing names for me.
"There are internal issues for which initial additional file can not be downloaded.. even after uninstalling several times ,  same problem is happening. I have not get any chance to play a match at all..its fruatating"
"This game is really good, otherwise there are some things we would like to change. First of all,  It would be lovely for you to change the guest mode,  as it is quite annoying as you cant chat properly or even change your name.It would be very nice for you to change it. Thank you"

"Among Us isnt bad of a game. night servers are the best servers to play with nice people. and people ruin that sometimes. So for the people that gave it bad reviews,  just come back and look at this. you wont be disappointed."
It sucks. I cant go in game anymore because i keep disconnecting. Even with good internet i cant join. But i ones had imposter and i got disconnected in the middle of the game. Please fix all of these bugs because the game really sucks now.

"I think among us is a great app to download if you like playing with your friends and family,  if you like sabotaging places and killing players or if you like completing tasks and booting people out a space ship or more I even got my mum to play it and thats saying alot about this game."
"This game was awesome until the chat update. You cant explain if your accused,  you cant explain if you find someone sus. I rarely play the game now just because of the chat system. Please change the chat like it use to be,  this game was so much fun."
I like it but at the same time I dont like it . I can join the same team as my friend if they sign out look at the code and they have to join back in and by the time theyre done that the lobby is already full. So they add a friend list so you can join the same lobby as your friends. NO HATE

"So then,  Ive downloaded the game after 6 months and can see that theyve reintroduced free chat (huray),  HOWEVER,  in capital,  the game is still filled with hackers  cheats who can see impostor,  or in a game of 1 impostors you see 2. Devs need to sort this out."
This is a great idea to make this game and I want to thank innersloth for making among us and the new update (the airship map). Gamers only want this game (maybe). Update if you have the clean vent task then if you stay there the imposter is very likely to kill you or people will think you vented
"I used to rate this game five stars but almost every time a game starts I get a black screen,  and also I used to have a lot of progress but then i un installed among us and now it saids i did nothing."
I really LIKED this game. But yall changed it. Now you cant chat anymore. Which makes it so hard to communicate because it takes forever. I only play with people in person anymore.

The game is very fun especially if you play with friends I know many people might not appreciate the update but I have really no problem with it. One thing that bothers me is that there some inappropriate names for players.. other than that its a fun game 5 stars

I really like the game but if when you went on find game there could be a search button and like you can search the name of the server than I would give you a five star  but you dont have to
I like this game but the chat box is annoying and my friend told that you can just fix it then 15 player lobby is great I unninstalled this game before I know that you can fix chat box
This game is great but there are some children playing this game who ban players for saying hi or hello or for just winning as the impostor. I need this to stop. I dont want to get banned for no reason please stop this and I will rate it 5 stars.The game is great though 
The game now improved a lot. Great work guys. But still you forget to include one important thing. Please include an exit icon on top right corner of home page. As currently we have to close the app by pressing home button.
"I hate the new update Im on computer and,  I got it to play with my siblings and it said it needed to be updated so I did. Then my mouse was gone and I couldnt play.... If I could give zero stars I would. I used to love this game but now its just stupid"
"The game is dead for a start. It is still enjoyable considering the rubbish update and over intoxicated players. But every 2nd game,  I keep getting disconnected. Ive tried on multiple devices and locations but I cant seem to get a full game done. Sort yourself out devs"
It was the best game until the new update where it becoming so complex. Maybe introducing proximity voice chat into the game as a new update will help to solve them
I love this game very much but when I was singing in the account for free chat to have permission I go to Gmail but there was no Gmail of innersloth parent portal so I am giving 2 stars has any one have solution for this

I would rate the version before the update 5 stars but I dont like the quick chat. I cant find what a want to say in time and its quite frustrating. the only good thing is that you can say really funny sentences.
"I used to live this game,  but then they added accounts. Now you have to sign up for an account to be able to have free chat or even have a custom display name. Makes more hassle."

First of all i do not like the update u are very limited on what you can say in chat while playing with other people plus there is not enough time for voting with the update it will be confusing for new players when dealing with this
"This game was really nice before the update but now like you cant really socialize with people properly y cant say how are you today,  y cant say something like that , honestly when i play this game i feel like im just playing among us , i feel like im playing offline mode , i used to play this gam...Full ReviewThis game was really nice before the update but now like you cant really socialize with people properly y cant say how are you today,  y cant say something like that , honestly when i play this game i feel like im just playing among us , i feel like im playing offline mode , i used to play this game when i was bored alot but now when im bored and i play this game im still bored this game droped its quality (no hate to the game or anyone thats just my opinion)i am not a bot yall"
"This game is so amazing With more players the feels so much better,  and I like the new vent cleaning task. It is scary as crewmate and easy kill for impostor. 5 stars."
The reason that I rated this 3 stars is because I dont really like the new updates. I mean I get the fact that people are dirty and all of that but I would like to be able to say whatever I want and personally dont say anything bad. And my game also crashes when it trys to load into a game.
Great game but the new animations need to go. The old ones were way better. And you also have to bring back the free typing and the freedom of the names.
"garbage game,  cant type in chat anymore. EDIT devs people dont want an account,  its useless feature. Not allowing people without account to type killed the game. Chat was what made this game shine. Delete quick chat wheel feature and allow everyone to type in chat like before."
"This game is severely broken after the update. Other players will either be invisible,  or pink blocks or just their hat. Movement freezes and you have to switch back and forth between touch and joystick. Also,  quick chat is horrendous."
"Theres only one word for Among Us Fun. I love it,  even though online bullying is a problem. I actually have a suggestion.

I love it,  even though online bullying is a problem. I actually have a suggestion.

After that,  you can empty the chute. I dont know,  itd be cool if you guys even see this comment. Thanks for the great game"
"Among us has gone very far downhill. The new child restrictions are ridiculous and making the game very hard to play for anyone who is under 13. And the parent portal requires you to prove youre an adult via credit card info or SSN wich is not a good way if doing so.

Good game but the updates kind of ruin my whole gameplay. Whenever I try to type it doesnt let me. And I cant change my name. Or chat in games. And when I joined lobbies everyone was surrounded with a pink square and you could only see their hats. I dont like the update fix it please
Its bad. You cant even type what you want. Its hard for fast typers like me. If you can type words in thid game i will rate 5 stars.

Innersloth you better fix it cant even type such a bad game making it like when someone says its Blue and every one votes for Blue. Ot makes no sense. Because we cant even type you can fix it.Innersloth
"When among us was released, i ignored it but then i saw my lil bro playing it and now i tried itIts so fun but then its now updated.....I dont like the quick chat because i was struggling saying something....inersloth..Please bring back the free chat....Actually, its still a little bit fun...."
"Ugh You cant say whatever you want anymore,  like i have medbay scan or something,  1 star cause when the game ends or an impostor gets voted out all the players only see a pitch black screen and they all quit. This update sucks"
"Its an amazing game,  I love to play I recently got a phone an this was the first app i got. If Im gonna be honest I love being the imposter,  Bwahahaha... cant die only kill (unless I get ejected). The tasks are super cool. I totally recomend this game its really fun"
"Having to sign in is soooooo disappointing and irritating. Mine would not even let me sign in. I loved to old verizon and now all it is is disappointing,  awful and,  if I could give it a negative 30 I WOULD. PLEASE GO TO THE OLD VERSION."
Why change to the quick chat Completely ruined the game play. The whole point is to communicate. Why take away the only important must have feature
"Very cool addictive. I give it 4 stars as of the broken avatar screen. When i set to guest account,  i could not change it back so yeah whateves"
"Ok so when the new update came,  I went into the calendar there was a emergency meeting I cant even talk the only was Id the options,  I cant even say it with my own words,  and theres also more,  plz fix this update some can talk with our own words Probably none like this update"
"I edited this review,  I originally rated this as one star but I have turned it to five stars bc this is actually a good game,  i did not realize that you can change the chat options and name options,  I apoligize for the previous review and and how misleading it was."
I love this game very well is just that I rated it four stars because when I finished signing with my email it started to say I must wait for my guardian to give permission so I can chat and my guardian told me okay but when I went back to play and I was a crewmate I saw purple vent so I tried to ch...Full ReviewI love this game very well is just that I rated it four stars because when I finished signing with my email it started to say I must wait for my guardian to give permission so I can chat and my guardian told me okay but when I went back to play and I was a crewmate I saw purple vent so I tried to chat but I could not so pls change the chatting side like the old among us but leave the remaining and now I cannot play among us without chatting Thank you
Ill give a higher star count when I can play the game again. I go to click into find a game and wont take me to the next screen. Cant create a game either. I play on a REVVL 5G.
"I loved the game before the update,  im happy there are almost NO adds and if there are they are not inaproprate but now the game is kind of boring as a crewmate and only fun as impostor. I would recromend a hide and seek mode,  that will get more people to play and I would absolutely love that"

I love this game it is so so fun but the only thing is that if you keep on joining different servers itll make you wait for 10 or 5 minutes but I love and highly recommend this game.
Havent played in a while decided to redownload and after 1 game i saw how terrible the comms are now. All the preselected phrases drain the game of fun. This is the fastest download and delete of anything for me
Was use to be great but now it really sucks when they changed the chat. You where use to be able to say whatever you want and now you have to pick a suggestion and it has ruined the game. I miss the old among us so much it was literally the best game and now it sucks

"OK. My private feedback isnt working anymore. I love the game but since the lobby was started,  it keeps kick me out of the game serveral times. Like,  EVERYDAY Please tell me whats going on... I dont want the same thing happened again.."
"Heres a new map theme Its aquatic kinda like Atlantis And then their can be new hats like Mermaid gills ect. O we have a snow map, air map,  a ship map ,  and a kinda ground map So mabey we can add a water map and it can be called Atlantis"
"A lot of people are complaining that they cant chat properly,  but thats because theyre too lazy to make an account. This game is really great and the only downfall is the fact that the community is not great,  but thats what discord servers are for."

My dad says it maybe the fact its having a issue with the files access and the permissions,  so try and fix this if its not just me please"
This game used to be my favorite game until the worst update. Very disappointed. Please make it better. I would give a better rating if you would keep it fun. 1 star.

I triedto uninstall the game and then install it but stillthe problem isnt solved ."
"Still great game i love how u add a 15 player game,  but the quick chat feature made the game a little boring to play,  its hard to communicate with other players,  so if manage to bring back the normal chat feature im sure alot of people will play this game again."
I think I speak for most of the players who used to wanna play this cus it was fun but the changes have had a huge impact on it I hope they see this and if they do please change the chat back it would make alot of people love it again
This used to my favourite game since 2017 and then they ruined by adding auto chet. And you need log in to play the game fix the game update it I well be more fun to play with.
"Awfull At first the game was addicting you could say,  the update has ruined everything. You cant chat Thats stupid ( after reading ur response,  thats changed my star rating a bit Thanks for the respond. )"
Its a fun game but when you uninstall and it doesnt give your old account back and it just says make sure guardian is okay with account and it still lets you play as guest

Its really fun and Ill love to make this game into a 5 star but there is only one thing about it that I dont like its that it would be cool if you add a cleaning the floor task

All they seem to know how to update in this game is their fonts. They added a new total of 15 players. Still hackers or moders. Still server delays (kills happening even though a body has been reported or meeting called). Fix the game before you expand it.
You have to be 18 to get free chat and to log in your account....make an account on google play....among us is such a nice app but they show alot of ads but also when i am playing a game then when i leave they say you are intentionally disconnected which isnt nice but among us is going to get bette...Full ReviewYou have to be 18 to get free chat and to log in your account....make an account on google play....among us is such a nice app but they show alot of ads but also when i am playing a game then when i leave they say you are intentionally disconnected which isnt nice but among us is going to get better and better so be prepaird thank you innersloth and there is going to be a new road map and a submerged map i think i saw stuff on youtube about it and i saw on websites
Before this update everything was fine. You could put ur name in and chat freely. But now the games is so ruined. The only thing I find good is the airship map but I dont care about that so can u please I mean PLEASE replace it. Thank you.
This game is amazing but it can get as bit boring sometimes and it can get boring when you are not crewmate but I will highly recommend this game.
The game is really fun and I like the new app and how your phone color is the color of your characters skin. I only gave it 4 stars because I just miss the old feeling but thats not anyones fault. Byeee
"Yall tried to fix that bug that was freezing players but just made it worse lol used to be a work around to tap the map and unfreeze but now im just frozen,  even as a ghost. Once thats fixed,  its a 5 star game."
"The game is fun and entertaining,  one issue is with the intentional disconnect feature,  I got kick out of the lobby because of my internet and couldnt join a round so please fix that."
The game was good for some reason its 3 stars the problem is i cant even type in the chat we just have to use the quick chat
This game was fun and all but now after all the updates I never got to be an imposter like I have played for a thousand times but still always a crewmate... Idk if its with my luck or just something with the app.
"Ok,  its still good after donkeys years. but my friend cant use free chat. You know that arrow facing downwards near Languages Yeah,  add that to Quick chat settings,  or just get rid of quick chat."
"Theres something that is missing and was always perfection. I liked when you DID NOT NEED TO PAY TO MAKE UR NAME. Thus,  I want free chat back on the game .You could type and make ur own name I like new colors and all but PLEASE LET US HAVE FREE CHAT AND NAME OF UR OWN BACK..XOXO"
I used to like the game a lot until the new update. Now we need to like log in or something like that. Now I cant even play the game. The new update has made a little my bad reviews so I think that you should change the new update.
The app keeps on getting shut down and I have tried everything recemonded. Among Us itself is a fun game but it certainly has some bugs. i.e. not letting me play on the app.
I preferred being able to type my own response. Its extremely aggravating to have to download something else just to be able to talk. Still like the game play tho.
I know the game we have to sign in but its a great I love this game I can be impostor crewmet its super amazing. But I love the new uptade and the old one is better I miss the old version )

And Im just gonna remind you guys to pls add the new submerged map.
This is an amazing game People are giving this 1 star because of the chat feature but its not innersloths fault its actually our fault because we all are saying bad word so technically this chat feature exists because of us

I think it would be nice to have a separate hide and seek option. Many prople like to play hide and seek in the game but many dont care for it so having a seperate game for this would be very helpful
"A great game but still has glitches and will say that it is not responding and will kick you out of game. If you are patient enough to deal with this sometimes,  this is an amazing game"

"I used to play among us when it didnt have airship I was so excited for the new map but... I hate that we cannot write what we want to. Likehi,  hello,  good game etc. But I still recommend you to download Among us its still a nice game."
Look I want to give the game 5 stars but I will not till this game is fixed. Now I have difficulties entering games and most times it keeps getting the dead body report for all the players even if they are alive. When the game is fixed I will give it a 5 star nice review.
"This game is very well put together with a great community, the only thing I cant understand is the match making it will say 3out of ten so I click on it and it will say full other than that great game I recommend"
This game is good but please on your next update make that game so you cannot ban people with out three other players banning them to because people keep there surver on public and then ban people when they join for no reason thank you if you can put this update on the game if possible.
Amazing game good for breaks while studying u can play and include your friends too  And design your character it doesnt lag much it depend on your wifi . And has no adds
Like the game cant get into a single game anymore nd keep getting kicked and banned for signal issues which I dont have. Insane amount of hackers in game aswell which causes alot of glitches.
"I get coppa laws and things like that,  but taking away the chat completely for kids makes no sense. You already have a chat filter,  you dont need another one."
When the game newly launched it is amazing but now we cant type anything it was very bad feature plz do it so we can write it again in among us we have to find words and some words are also not there pl z do 1 change that was we can type thats its
"It was great before but the newest update made everything horrible. the chat system is ok but,  the game keeps glitching I cant see clearly,  its all black The only time I can see is when I die. plz have this fixed and I will gladly give it five stars"
This game is hilarious as everybody says and its great the fact that is like a mystery to solve.But I have one big problem.7 months playing this game and just 2 times impostor.I mean you need to make the impostor chance higher like 15 or I dont know.Thats all I got.Thank you

"This sucks They should have never changed the chat,  it was more fun being able to type and discuss in depth through the chat. Ruined the whole game."
This game in proved a little now you have 15 people its more harder for the inposter but if the chat was fixed it would be better and just fix your bugs ok the game might be a big hit some day agian
To great game Things I dont like People ask people on dates as far as if seen But come on guys be appropriate also people leaving when they get caught as imposter anyways 5 stars give the great work up 
One star its bad and you have to do this dumb sign in and every time I hit resend email it just pops up again I tried to update it but it didnt even do anything fix your game and improve please
This game is very fun but when I try to chat in a game I cant type anything. I dont know if its about my wifi or because I played as a guest..

I really loved this game until they changed the chat system it makes it impossible to try and get to the point and say that you can scan or something

Its fun to play and stuff but me and my family all wanted to join eachother and it wouldnt let us saying game not found when one of us were on it. We put it in correctly so I dont know why it didnt work but yeah. Pls fix this
I loved playing among us but after the update the game got boring because you cant have fun making jokes in the chat or just talk on your own...I believe among us is gonna get popular again if you can talk freely... PLZ FIX THIS

Among us if you change this i will change my rates to 5.
Among use to be 5 stars but 2021 chat has made the game worse. You have to press buttons to say something. Like to say who it is you have to press the talking button then press cremate and press which one and send. Its horrible

Mostly my hero acedemia,  all the other roleplayers ignore you and keep going. ITS starting to bug me. Also quick chat not that bad,  just login Its not permanent."
Dev of among us remove the chat feature its annoying and pls remove it and. I used too like the old chat. cause it has simple chat and the new one its just limiting the funnest of the game I gave 3 stars cause I used to enjoy the game if you do not remove it in 5 or 7 week Ill changed it 2 stars

"Loved the ORIGINAL VERSION. What made the game fun was how you could talk like yourself and have YOUR OWN Personality. Now that its automated text,  its very bland and the game is no longer fun to solve the mystery."
"I love among us the only problem is that you cant send freind requests,  there were two people I was playing with for and hour but then it disconnected us and I probably wont be able to play with them ever again"
I wanna say I hate the new version because you cant type the name you want.the old version is better because you can type the name you want BRING BACK OLD AMONG US
These game is cool and those saying that they cant chat . I have a solution for them . First  Delete the game then reinstall it. And set your birth date 18 then only you chat freely this process will work. I my one star is missing because of that problem.
Awsome Game but on the inner sloth YouTube channel it said there was gonna be like a bunch of updates but there has been like 1 or 2 updates since then and they have only been bug fixes
For some reason I can not use chat at all and that is the only way to communicate with others and its just not fair how other people can use chat and not the people who download it in this version please fix the bug if it is a bug and for singing in to a account it does not take in the email and th...Full ReviewFor some reason I can not use chat at all and that is the only way to communicate with others and its just not fair how other people can use chat and not the people who download it in this version please fix the bug if it is a bug and for singing in to a account it does not take in the email and thats why I give it a two
Amazing just absolutely amazing and I would suggest this game for someone who likes to challenge its very entertaining and fun
Among Us is great game. Innersloth i would love the game even more if you fix that you need to wait like 15 minutes before you can join another game. Thank you.
Arguably this is one of the best games Ive played but theres a little thing that might change the game but make it more fun which is to higher the rate of imposter rounds and bye.

"Very annoying,  in the new update it is very hard to communicate. Your chat system even lags,  when I was trying to say vote (A) in the chat,  there wasnt the name of imposter. Please bring back old chatting system,  why the heck are you wrecking the game...."
Before the airship update this game is 1 in my books. Its better when you bring back the free chat instead of clicking those buttons its very very annoying.
"Among us was a fun game I have been playing it for almost 2 years and it is a good game but after they put the new chat and we cant say what we want is disappointing the new map is ok,  but now the game is not fun anymore overall I am disappointed"
Beautiful game but needs something new for the imposter because its impossible to win a game with 15 players unless you have three players but nobody else wants to play with three imposter and these mha servers just ruin the game I hope you guys can do something about it
I used to rate it one star because the game kept crashing and would stop. I rate it two stars now since i used to really like this game and it would have no problem loading.

Its really fun but it really needs to add a friends list so u can friend people and play with them again and also if I want to band someone sometimes there name wont pop up
very good app lots of new fechures and so much fun but you need to pick from a wheel what you want to say and that is the bad thing but over all it is a good app so i recommend it
I love this game so much We can FreePlay so we dont Really bored and It added More color Thanks you so much for making Gray color and I really appreciate your game and your update everytine keep the good work Your game gonna be popular forever
"Make it so to get an account you need to write a name (Not taken,  Not Randomized) and Password (8 characters a minimum) I love the feel but the accounts are horrid for me."
I like it for the most part but I use it for roleplay and when I lose my game it takes like two three hours to find it again so the only thing I would change is I wish that there was a role play room so that we can role play and not get disconnected
"Best Game Ever Seen,  Excited for the Submerged Map What if in freeplay mode,  dummies could move And there would be olive and mint colour with maximum 20 players "
"This game youst to be my favorite game until the update happened. It almost took me took me 1 hour to load in through all the updates it gets so laggy,  you cant put your name as what you want or talk about anything you want its kinda gone boring."

"the games idea is worth 5 stars but  the crewmates when youre a crewmate are stupid  which the devs cant control  but uh,  Id expect a game to not be so easily hackable,  so that all they can do in response is ASK TO STOP HACKING."
"Even with the new update,  you cant select free chat. This has made the game boring. Among us used to be really fun to play but now its not something Id play again. If I could give it a lower rating,  I would. Sorry"
"I used to like playing among us but,  i had recently reinstalled it and im having bad issues like it wont load when the game starts or i cant move an it just wont work i have been hearing about that update with the chat and i fully agree with them."
"I think its a really fun game over all Im glad its not one of those games where theres a load of ads,  it can get a bit repetitive but its a great game "
It used to be good game but the update is awful I need to make and account on Google play to chat with people and I dont have enough space for Google play so I use the normal chat and it is so annoying I cant type what I want at all

Good fun but I always get the same tasks so I do my them really quickly and I end up looking sus so can we get a better task randmiser also can we get a mod page or something because I think the game would be better with mods p.c has them but pocket edition players dont I think it is unfair
I liked the old one better I dont like the chat update you cant type what you want to type and it makes it not s fun but overall its a good game (  )

"This is a very good game,  I hope you are making more maps . But I have given 4 stars because it takes Guardians permission to chat and says it has sent and email but there is no email . I hope you fix it. Keep it up."
this game is one of the best games I have ever played its really fun and advertising sometimes it gets a little glitchy but that just might just be my internet connection but its definitely 5 stars

Detective (good)  the detective will gather clues of a player it dosent tell the player vented or sabataused or killed someone. BUT be carful your clues can be WRONG 2. Bomber (Evil)  the bomber can place bombs around the map (also can kill and do etc. like an imposter.) then heshe can trigger it and then the crew has to stop it from it to explode the imposter and the bomber can do the task to stop the bomb from exploding too.

Thank you for adjusting the problem of the free and quick chat options ) this really helped me because I am having a tough time using quick chat in game now I can go back to my usual of playing among us.

"Update the app has gotten a LOT better. You can type now,  and have your own name,  you can report people too. I like that you can change the amount of imposters as host while in the game,  overall its gotten a lot better"
"among us is a really fun game and Ive loved playing it for a year , but the update were you cant type your own things is terribleupdate it now becuase this is a horrible update.do better"
This game is very good I didnt gave the last leftover star cause it has little bit of problem in loading. Pls improve that. So hopefully next time I will give u all 5 clean stars Thanks for ur attention
"I like the original chat because we can talk everything we like now its boring and you cant change your name anymore,  and no accounts its boring,  it used to be cool and Im not happy with the new among us chat its hard remeber there names,  and inner sloth put there characters right by the names."
"Great game,  good gameplay the prices for skins and pets are low.Love playing the game the chat system in kinda dumb becuase if you dont have a google play acount you have to use quick chat I mean I have one but others might not but over all great game deffently recomend it."
it would be five but they made the chat so you cant t type on your own and you have too pick preset chats and its so confusing and stupid This game used too be a lot better 
I love the game the tasks and the new map but I hate the new awful chat system its so difficult to explain urself or if someone is suspecting u. You cant frame proper sentences and cant explain anything I am done with this ga.e not gonna play till they fix the chat to normal
THIS GAME IS AWESOME AND I CANT STOP PLAYING IT but this game would be better if ya add friend list so when ya meet new person and wanna be friends with them just add them to the list and play with them whenever ya want
This is the best game ever I love it theres one thing can u ad that u dont have to paywhy have you changed the chat its so slow you have to figure out which catalog has the rings you wanna say please change it back to the way it was
I love the game itself but I hate the chat and acount thing I wish it the developer never changed it. After it was changed I stopped playing for a long time.

Its a good game u can play with ur friends and its entertaining but theres like hackers and glitches that what I dont like but its a good game and people could use curse words so please fix that
This game sucks. I use to like it not until people vote you out for no reason. Its stupid. It happened to me in every single game. if you ad a voice chat it would make my day.
"I have a ton of fun with this game,  my only problem is the terrible community,  I always get servers that say 18 and its just annoying. Overall the game is great."
It was a awesome game once but now it has changed and it became a trash game . We cannot chat freely that means the game has became worst than before. Pls fix this ASAP that i can play this game once again freely chating with others and making friends. Thank you
Good app but now I cannot change my color or play in freeplay mode. When I am playing in airship mode its breaking. Its fine in my phone but not in my tab. After the new update these problems came. Please look into it.
OMG this game is amazing It is really fun and I can understand why so many people love it Great game. Totaly recomend it. Does get a little boring when you are the crewmate a lot of times in a row though.

I use to love this game but after the update there has been alot of bugs. When you join a server your whole screen black. I prefer 2020 among us. I hope you can fix this bug soon and i will change give you 5 stars.

I used to love this game and today i thought id install it again and every time i tryed playing it kept disconnecting me from the server. Honestly the creaters should put it back the way it was in my personal opinion. Please and thank you
Used to be an amazing game. Then they took away the ability to actually type conversations. Then they took away the ability to have a name... This app is taking big steps backwards

Its an awesome app I would play it all day if it had a chance the only problem I have with it is if you want to go to a different app it takes you out of the game other then I totally recommend it if you are an competitive person
I love the game but to take a pet we need to give money. I sometimes enter a game witch need 15 player but it has 10 i enter it sayed its full. Please make a level of under water like airship Anyway please add under water too.

I loved this game and I am so sad to be leaving this review. The inability to type in chat completely ruins the game. Theres no point in playing a game like this where you are unable to talk to other people.

This game is fun in all but I dont like that you have to pay to get free chat it would be a great change to the players of among us.
Best game ever made but the creators of the game should also add some Mods in to sence on YouTube many people have added mods of their own most people who see those videos they also want to play them but they cant so it would be very amazing and cool if the creators added some Mods frome youtube
"Hello innersloth the game is very good and entertaining but my request is please please please add these game modes 1. town of us 2. Hide and seek 3. Cops and robbers 4. Zombies 5. When imposter sabotage lights crewmates have torchlights in their hand 6. New roles like doctor ,  sheriff etc"

"Great game,  seems all the complaints are coming from people who dont know how the game UI works. Maybe make an ingame guide on their questions."
I do love playing the game but its sometimes annoying because theres bugs like at times although im signed in it doesnt work to get in a lobby n sometimes the game crashes
"This used to be one of my fav game,  but after the update it made this game so boring and complex...why maps are so complex,  why there is no option for custom chat and where the original map went...it just went downhill after update....("
I used to play this game with all my friends and it used to be really fun and then they updated it ad it was less fun to play and the fact you have to make an account to chat freely is just dumb

All Im saying is you need to change it back. If this update goes on any longer Im going to start pulling my hair out Please put it normal again
When i started playing this game it was fun but not when this update came i cant even chat properly i would give it a 5 star if you make the chat back to normal because i really hate using that stupid wheel

This is a very good game because there are many update coming one by one and this thing I love most in the next update the submarine map coming and I am excited to the submarine map. So this is why I give 5 stars.
"I like this game. I am not playing this game for a long time. Then other games have a few glitch but not this game ,  thank you for created this game."
High lag..Game disconnects and when you try to join another one it says you cant join for another few minutes when they only disconnected..Issue needs to be fixed
"It was good before,  but now when a game starts The screen is dark for hours Please fix this or I will never play this game again"
This game is slowly getting bad.Not like the last update you cannot type in chat anymore I think almost all of the players in the game has the same issue.I rarely play this game because of this update please fix this thank you and stay safe.
"Its very nice Game,  but i give 4star is for that black screen,  when I join game it shows only black screen and it not joins game. PLZ FIX IT"
"Wow the room loading screen is so long now. And when the game is full you will tiringly go back to public private page and goes back in again,  and choose room again. Triple waiting time now."
it is a amazing game i want to give it 5 star but i have give it 3 stars because in airship map which coolest map there is a lift and sometimes i have to wait for that lift and the imposter kill me. please do something for this
Its okay I loved it before the updates it changed alot and its hard to type and signing in is dumb I dont love it but i dont hate it Its okay but I really hate these things if you can fix this it will be amazing again thanks
Its a really great game but every once in a while it doesnt allow me to sign in and o have to wait an entire day untill it works again. If someone knows how to stop that then five stars.
"Best game ever because you can play with friends and stranger, new maps,  15 players and others. In order will free chat you must sign in to your acount on order the free chats are back."
I used to love this game but with the new update its hard to communicate thats why I gave 3 stars otherwise the game is amazing.

Honestly a pretty dry experience. Hackers are common and there is no way to report. They havent made any steps to make the game better with updates. The only thing fun is when people make hide and seek games.
I can give it 5 stars or 100 STARS but I dont like the account update and the chat update I was playing a match of mira HQ the lights was off I reported a dead body and I couldnt said the lights were off and I couldnt see the body LIKE WHAT but its still a good game just remove the account and c...Full ReviewI can give it 5 stars or 100 STARS but I dont like the account update and the chat update I was playing a match of mira HQ the lights was off I reported a dead body and I couldnt said the lights were off and I couldnt see the body LIKE WHAT but its still a good game just remove the account and chat update but I recommend to try this game
Thank you so much for bringing the chat back I can finally play in peace But i cant give 5 star cuz its lagging too much and buggy but thanks for the chat back

Its a great game. But... It doesnt let you type you need to choose the words and you need to tap the word I liked it more when I could type whet I want to type.
"Used to be an incredible game,  bit ever since the update a few months back the game has refused to load on my phone (Redmi 9). Very dissatisfied."
I think the old version is much better than this one. Its hard to communicate with others if we cant speak freely and we cant put the names we want. I think it would be a best choice if youll bring back the old one. Thank you
"the game was much better about 10 months ago,  now we cant talk freely  and that download of additional assets takes too long to finish. Enfim"
Its fun and I love this game and I love that it has no ads.but it sometimes glitches so I rated five stars.
"Hi,  can you please change the chat back. We cant discuss freely anymore and makes it extremely frustrating. It used to be so perfect,  no offense. Pls change it back. Sometimes I even lose hope,  there is no point in the game if we cant have our freedom of speech. But the rest is perfect. "
"I like the game so much but 1 problem is,  i cannot talk properly during the meeting. Its confusing how to use the communication option during the meeting."
"This has been my favorite game,  until the update. I mean,  the game itself is great,  but since the update,  it hasnt been social. I have a hard time socializing irl,  so it kinda helped me out of my comfort zone. Can we pls have the game go back to that "
This is an awesome game however the new update is good because now I can use chat again but I still give it 3 stars.
I love the game but the problem is that you cant type freely or we cant type a name you have to pick a random one and there too many
"Its ok,  would be alot more play with friends if you could just search by their username andor their code. Cause sometimes the network disconnects n then cant find em for days."
This game used to be so fun I would play all the time but the new chat and names things I dont get I signed into my account and I still had to use the confusing chat this game isnt the same anymore ( its less fun
"It was the best games for quarantine,  but with the new GUI,  it feels like a kids game. The GUI has too much open space  feels empty."
"I downloaded this on my samsung chromebook. Everything was working fine until it wasnt. It wont let me sign in,  whenever I click sign in,  it just lags my laptop.."
"I reviewed among us five stars because it usta be the best game ever and I would play all the time,  but since the newest update,  it really sucks.

Why do I have to do so much stuff just so I can talk in chat and change my username,  like Jesus Christ I just wanted to play some among us and ya guys just had to make this update and ruin the whole freaking game. I just wanted to play one game of among us,  I just wanted to change my username to lol_i(I think u know y) no wonder it has such bad reviews"
"This game was very popular before the update but trust me you can still put it back to normal just copy what you tube did they removed the new added feature after receiving a lot of 1 reviews,  now theres still time to put it back to normal."
"The only possible downside I can think of is the disability to rename myself,  and send texts to the other crewmates to clarify that Im clear as a crew mate.

This update has made it a pain to even win a game as the imposter because I get accused for not talking in either Reports or Emergencies. Other than those 2 mistakes the developers made,  this game is good,  and a bad way to end someones friendship"
Thank you for this new lovely update innersloth I love the new animation of the game There are new colors new  Dead bodies new Vent Cleaning Task and i hope innersloth dont just put Voice Chat on this game please Im ok with just chat ... if you read this please reply Love your game
"I loved Among us before the update. Dont get me wrong,  I do enjoy the new map,  colors,  and player capacity in every game,  but the new chat is definitely not a favorite."

Previous versions were much more better. Quick chat has destroyed the whole game Even I cant find the option to select free chat. Earlier chats used to be much more easy and interactive. Please remove quick chat immediately.
Before airship update this game was cool and I can do public chat and put my name in my own. After the update of airship this game lost my 5star ratings. Because of I cant chat freely and I cant put my own name. So many of bugs also present. Now your ratings are decreasing 5 star to 1 star.
I like this game very much and because of the chat update everyone was angry but I found a way if you put your dob before 1975 you can type normally and you will get option to select quickvhat or freechat
This game was so good my friend use to love it to. I used to troll ny Friend in this game but after update to sign in my game doesnt work when I try to click online button or create it take so long time to go. Not playing this game again. (
I love the game but ever since the new map came I cant go on any severs cause of how long it takes to load and normally I would be okay with if it ever actually loaded the sever so please fix that Thanks
I need to report a bug while I was playing I was doing a task and the opening screen played again and half the people turned into imposters and then it ended I tried to talk but couldnt and the number of people said 015 when really there were 15 people please fix this.
"So when I try to download the additonal assets for the game it the bar doesnt move. But when I decline it and try to play,  It just stays on a black screen. Fix this please."
"would rate it a 5 stars but ehh I havent played among us in a long time and I decided to play it again,  I was the imposter when someone called the emergency meeting I couldnt chat,  the chat thing just messed up the game."
"Really fun game. The only compliant I have is that there should be a friend system. Like being able to send a friend request to other players in the lobby,  and you can invite them to other games."
"Ive gotta say this game is nice but the update is half annoying half not. Lets start with annoying. First of all THE CHAT. We can all agree bubble chat sucks. Last,  the bugs lately Its insane. Half not is the restof the update"
It is the bestest game bu t I have a problem that There should be no VIP so in this game all can be equal costume and if there would be levels so it will be more fun and in each level there should be different map so it will be a race but its all fine
"Fun Game But.. The one thing I hate and I hope they change is the chat,  its so dumb how you have to click buttons for what you want to say. I would rather type then that"
"Can you fix the chat,  so we can type what we want to say instead of having to find it and sometimes it might not have what we want to say."
Its great I dont like the chat update it made ppl crazy I always get voted out make it so in settings it says control chat when you do no it will show it and maybe its ppl saying bad stuff so make it so when they say it they get kicked out or banned From the lobby
I really like Among Us but every time I try to play on phone the screen goes black when the game starts. Not sure if its my problem. But Id love if its fixed.
Hello I love this game very much but theres a bug when i joined a game the moving thingy did not appear all i could do is moving the screen for example moving the screen up and down it was very hard to do this so please fix this bug
Ok so I love this game and hv seen reviews abt ppl complaining abt the chat being turned to quick chat but literally you can fix that in seconds by going into the settings. I think this game rocks i play it all the time. I especially love all the new colors.
This game used to be so good and you just had to ruin it with the new update you have to put that all that personal information in just to select your name please fix this and I just cant join public or host because it just infinitely loads.

Wrost game ever not even change the names and not support keyboard too no chat to other players and my parents were not reciving the guardiam main to control the game and also my network connection was excellent waste of time data do not download or cry after downloading it

This is a good game but know It doesnt work at all. I cant create games find games or play private servers. It dosent work with or without an account. If this is fixed i will rate yhis game 5

"Its ok but not what it used to be. The app charges money because your underage (from under 1318 years old) which is ridiculous. And the censorship is way to much,  they go as far as censoring words that are mild swears. Half the skins cost much and so the pets too. Hope it improves."

The game used to be extremely good but now its very bad now you need quick chat and its annoying cuz it doesnt make the game better it makes it less fun cuz if quick chat wasnt a thing I would give the game a five or four star rating

"i love this game sooooooo much but i would love to be able to customize your hats, skins, and pets all so to make your own has, skins, and pets"
Among Us is a fine game. It just has SOME glitches that happens often. When I enter a server it instantly kicks me out and it says disconnected although I have enough network. Pls fix.
"From 5 stars to 1. I used to love this game,  but since you cant type there is lack of creativeness. Oh and you cant use your nickname any longer,  its randomised."
Good game except there is a few bugs when i am the imposter the crewmates sometime win as soon as the game starts and on time i was playing and i was doing a task and the imposter somehow killed everybody when i was done my task so yeah please fix these bugs but overall Its A Great game

Before the update the game was really fun for everyone but now its not fun anymore when there was no chat update the game was fun but the safe chat sucks we cant make our own words anymore so you have to change it to free chat even if i go to the settings the quick chat you cant touch it
Look i love the game but i would really love it if you guys fix the chat problem because i cant talk to other people only using words that are already there in the game
"The game is perfect,  like how I left it one year ago. It is an amazing game,  but personally I would disadvantage who repeatedly leave the matches at the start of it,  they are very fastidious people."
The game has changed alot its not the same for example you cant even write in chat you have to choose your words but sometimes thats not what you really want. I prefer the old version
"Before they did the update I was playing this game everyday but now I need to sign in to chat and change my name I tried every account I have and accounts of my friends to sign in but it all didnt work it doesnt want to confirm anyone of it and the game keeps glitching and I cant enter any server...Full ReviewBefore they did the update I was playing this game everyday but now I need to sign in to chat and change my name I tried every account I have and accounts of my friends to sign in but it all didnt work it doesnt want to confirm anyone of it and the game keeps glitching and I cant enter any servers to play in it,  pls remove that update and let the old among us."
"HOW ANNOYINGLY DISAPPOINTED. Seriously My internet is top notch but the game keeps saying Net prob. Fix this bug Im in the middle of the game and then what,  lost my chance when Im the imp."

Hey come i cant even play with my younger relatives because of this stupid quick chat thing Now we have to have the same settings and we have to change a bunch of things just to play together instead of just giving the code over the phoneJust put it back to normal
I like this Game it has killing venting etc so much thing . But I would recommend to add friends in Because many people made friends in this game . and they lose their freinds
I loved this game before this used be my favourite game and i was playing this like 247 But now the update ruined it. Please if possible bring out the old version...it was the best. I am not spreading hate on the new version i just informed you guys my personal opinion...
"After the most recent update,  you ruined it,  you removed some colours a lot of people used,  you cant use a custom name,  and it wont let you log into an account,  its annoying,  please fix this"
It was good in the beginning thn it got a top trend but the constant updates have completely ruined it. Not to mention too much lagging and bugs . This game was good because it was simple and now its messed up.

"I used to love this game,  but the New update kinda ruined it for me. The funniest part was being able to talk with other people and now I cant anymore and its just not as fun as it used to be. I hope this will change in the future,  otherwise I will definitely stop playing"

This game cant get any better. But maybe you should make it vibrate in chat when someone says something and a run bar that allows you to speed up and will charge up if you stop moving 
"Ok,  so,  I started playing the game for the first time in a while,  and I gotta say,  they really fixed everything. This game is more decent now,  but it is kinda not the same as pre March update."
I really like the game but i think when you play a local game ya should be able to pick ai players too and needs more maps like a sewers map or an asylum map.

Server issues are causing me to not be able to play. When I click find game it just loads and never pulls up the room list. This game works for one day and stops working until each update. What the heck is going on
Among us used to be amazing I still love the art design but the new auto chat is 1. Confusing 2. Hard to accuse or say anything 3. Just not the same (1 star)
I loved this game but then they switch it so you can not type what you really want to say and i this that makes the game a lot less fun to be  but other than that i think it is pretty fun expecially when you are playing with family or friends.
"I love this game so much,  but ALOT Has changed.. you cant choose your name,  you cant talk,  and stuff like that please change this to the old among us."
It Was A Really Good Game Like Top 10 Of My Favourites But After The Update I Havent Touched The App At All You Cant Login Without It Saying SIGN IN OR USE A GUARDIANS ACCOUNT Or Something Like That And The Game Has Overall Just Died They Need To Fix The Game Otherwise It Will Just Start To Die ...Full ReviewIt Was A Really Good Game Like Top 10 Of My Favourites But After The Update I Havent Touched The App At All You Cant Login Without It Saying SIGN IN OR USE A GUARDIANS ACCOUNT Or Something Like That And The Game Has Overall Just Died They Need To Fix The Game Otherwise It Will Just Start To Die Fast
"When I install the app,  it took a LONG time just to go to the main menu. The gameplay was alright and the private server mode was awsome I rate this a average 35,  a good game"
Its a nice game but I put 3 because they added the safe chat which not a lot of us like so I dont really recommend to play or get this game but you can if you want but thats just a waste of time.

This also comes along with glitches such as not being able to sign in and many other thing.i guess i kinda reccomend it. Get it together please
"It was very fun until it was updated. i think it ruined the game because of quick chat,  so when i play no one can understand eachother plus i cant choose my name."
When it began to blow up it was an amazing game but then the quick chat came and it complicates things so much you can barley explain anything or socialize it ruined the whole game
Bro this game used to be the best now they changed for the worst you cant even type in chat any more you have to use the wheel thing and it sucks. They made the game so much worse it makes me want to play fortnite.
I am disappointed ...I really liked the older version more. I see half of the people outside the map and Also my half screen is black. Plz fix it Its my third time downloading the latest ver.
"This is game is still incredibly fun to play from time to time. The update doesnt really bother me at all,  and I like the new task,  colors,  and more. People seem to gripe about the new update,  but honestly I dont see why. This game is still very fun to play. "
"I downloaded this game about a year ago,  I really enjoy playing it with my cousin I recommend playing it. It is very easy to learn how to play it too. Edit One of the latest updates completely ruined the game. Please fix it."
I like this game but I have a very low chance of being imposter. My first game Im usually imposter them the rest Im only crewmate. Also could you make it to where ghosts dont have to attend emergency meetings.
The game is awesome. And I love that they continuously fix various reported bugs. Slight issue is airship is laggier on mobile but still I love everything else. Cant wait for next update.
"I use to love the games so much,  but then one of the updates made it so i cant text,  so i got voted out because i couldnt say the things i needed to say,  so i signed in and terned on typing in chat and self change name and i STILL couldnt type in chat,  but i could change my name.

Thank you for introducing this game to me and I love this game and I hope you bring back like many many more things to come to me because I really love this game and everything that is between it but it doesnt really like Amazon like Amazon I love you thank you so much hahaha
This game was great but ever since the updates you cant even make your own name also you cannot even type properly the game has specific words only and it causes the game to be hard trying to understand what people really mean.
"Why Just why The game was as good as usual yesterday but today any game that go into,  it just turns pitch dark just please do something about it.. Now I love this game but u really need to fix this issue"
Good game but the new chat thing is annoying it is just not even close to the old chat the old chat was so much better and in the new map you can choose where you start but every one should start at the same place

Maybe you can add chat by typing and change name (Not sign in)it helps a lot. Thanks innersloth ) (pls add this). Glitch need to fix too long to join a public game black screen during making a private server
This is great but there are to many idiots I feel there should be some way to put you with people with similar win rates. Also I keep disconnecting
"I love it at first but the new updates is quite disappointing. Its so hard to communicate when you cannot type your own comment when playing in it,  i have to click some word and its hard to find on which words i have to click"
I like this game a lot but I dont know why it isnt starting up it just shows me the loading screen I reinstalled the game but nothing changed. Please fix the problem as soon as possible

I realy like this game is really fun but i think they could include a different how to play for each map explaining each task because i just know how to play the skild and the other ones are a little more complex for me. BUT I LOVE THIS GAME
among us was a great game to play. The only thing I dont like about the game is the language update I cant type my name for my player anymore and just gives me a name I dont want and the chat wont let me type what I want to type this is why I gave it a two star game.
"The update was good. But the glitch still didnt go. While finding game i see the is less that 15 players. But where I tap there,  I see the game started or the lobby is full."
The original version was great and I loved this game. But the updated version is terrible. Auto chat option is so boring and confusing.
"Cool game I love the little crewmates,  but I do have on problem,  a lot of people has been online dating in this game and they need to be banned  but great game "
Thank you for fixing the quick chat and now we can talk freely. I didnt play this game since the airship map was released because we couldnt even chat or tell freely wht happened and now I am back and I have started playing it and imma lovin this game again 
The game itself is very cool. You just have to pay attention to the quality of the servers because they are slow and break down greatly
I wish there was an allocated option to give 0 stars. This game is absolute idiocy. Its extremely boring and has not continuity substance to its gameplay. Also there are a bunch of retarded kids.
"Great Game Though could you make the skins, hats,  and pets cause I really want to use them but dont have the money"

This would be 5 stars if i didnt have to wait after disconnecting a few times and then 10 MINUTES if you disconnect after that.

"Chat doesnt work,  it only works when your waiting for all the players,  i try to talk but it wouldnt work... i hate this. And i cant go on the airship like it just boots off and turns off"
"I left a very bad review months ago but now they have fixed everything that I was complaining about,  it is now way better than it was before. Great job devs the animation looks really good and the game overall is fun again thank you"
In the beginning it was such a good game But I feel that with the recent updates its kinda gone downhill and isnt as much fun. It was more fun to actually type responses.
Nice game and I really enjoy playing it but the only issue is that I keep getting disconnected in between the game.... please fix it.
"I love this game so much,  but with the new update it is boring. Like you cant talk anymore thet give you words what you can choose but you cant talk with your own words and THE people choose your own name so thats why I gave 4 out 5 buts its still nice.."
Played almost 50 times....still spawning as crew.... emergency meetings in first few seconds are frustrating.....one player can ruin the game by clicking emergency meeting button....
The update made it all weird but this app is amazing im absorbing into the world of Among Us. It is the best Sometimes some hacker join but i know how to deal with them. Im so excited for the new Submerged Map too. Hope you guys release it soon .
I give it three stars cause the new updates have taken the fun from the game and you have to quick chat instead of free chat it gets really hard to communicate with other people.When somone fakes a task I cant accuse them buy saying Brown faked Med scan No hate I just hope you fix this.
Im changing my rate 1 to 3 star. I like the game and the graphics but I like the old among us back. because I cant communicate what I want to say

I love playing among us but the only problem is that I keep getting disconnected from games. And I wish there was like a previous games played thing so you can see the last servers you where in and rejoin them

"I mean the recent problem was fixed now a whole lot of problems came in like when I am entering a game when it is about to start it freezes and it goes out of Among Us,  please fix these new problems."
The only thing I hate is cannot type freely it is so hassle to chose what to say in chat especially if you do not memorize the phrases.
The Worst think I faced lag Only in Airship Map Idk why Airship map is so laggy but sometimes when impostor sabotaged lights then my game works properly. Plz fix lag of Airship. Then Ill definately give you Five stars.
The game is fanatic but the only thing that is missing is voice chat feature plzz add ingame voice chat while playing instead of making us use discord which is of no work when we play online randoms plz add voice chat
It used to be really good untill the chat and account updates. I understand why but it is not fun without a chat. It would be better if bad words were just replaced with hashtags or something and I dont really understand the account thing.
"Used to be fun. New chat ruined the game. BUT if youre playing with friends using discord or whatever,  then playing this game will be really fun."

I used to love this game and would play it 247 but after they updated it and made it so you cant type your own response or have your own name it just went totally down hill. If they would at least let you write your own responses it would be amazing until then just no.
I really enjoy playing Among Us. The only thing I would prefer done differently is more preferences for joining a game (fast speeds are so annoying and make up 95 of servers).

This game would be great if you add a friend list or search option to find your friend in the game. And if the other player accepted your friend request then you could only chat with them.please add this in the game

Plus the account sustem Now works fine and we saw less Crimes And bots than The last year And I wish people should Press 5 Stars Back in Among us. Among Us is a Part of My Games Like Others. 1010.
I love this game the new version is ok i guess but i deleted this game and tried to download it and it shows 100 and stucks there pls fix this but the game is best no more complaints other than this issue pls fix it
It was fun when you could type but now you cant and it is not fun as long as they fix it to where you can type I will be very happy and play this game every day

So... What to say about among us... First of all back then this game was one of the best online games but the updates have ruined it and I cant even log on to play anymore. No wonder its dead now
"I absolutely LOVE the new updates,  and thank you so much for letting players type freely now U love the new animations and having everything redrawn. Love this game and thanks to these updates Im playing WAY more than I used to "
Its a good game but after the new update the game has become kinda boring because we cant chat on our own and even we cant selectwrite our own name. Please fix i would be glad.
i love this game so much i play it all the time like all the time but at the new update there is a glich. When a body gets reported all the body s get reported and we dont get to play it is very annoying so Im rating 3 stars
Pretty good But the cleaning vents task is a easy thing for the imposter to strike and say I was cleaning the vents and makes it much harder to play so please fix this but really good defo recommend it
"I personally like this game, auto chat is annoying though. I appreiciate this game,  but the older version was MUCH better."
"This game was so fun in the beginning until the new update had came,  it was so fun on the original version. But then the new version crashed into the original. So please,  bring back the original version."
"It is a great game and the new map is very cool,  but the chat options are very limited and it is boring .. if you can open the chat again so that we can write whatever we want it will be very wonderful"
"Its a really good game but the only problems are your colour is always taken,  you cant put custom chats being stuck to a selection bar to talk and theres a few bugs and glitches overall a good game"
"Chat stuck on quickchat,  literally unplayable... Need to be speed in typing here but now i gotta find words and bam until i frame a sentence im accused and ppl start kicking on me... Literally UNPLAYABLE"
I think it is a great game but the login thing sucks and my sister cant even play because of this. other than that great game.
"I like to play as the yellow. I run around doing tasks as a little yellow man. Very fun. My friends love it. 5 star game,  orang for life."
This game is cool but there is a lot of glitches and the chat type cant work cause we need to sign in but sometimes there is a lot of error thats why I rated 4 stars
"Ok the game is better,  due to the update but i wish the controls were more versatile like the move button starts where ever i put my finger at on the left side"
FIVE STAR BEST GAME EVER BUT IT HAS SOME BUGS LIKE I GET STUCK IN THE LADDER IN AIRSHIP ITS MAKE ME GO UP AND DOWN SOMETIMES WHEN I MOVE MY CHARACTER MOVE BUT MY SKIN AND HAT ARE NOT MOVING WITH ME LIKE THERE WERE JUST STICKERS AND WHEN I VENT SOMETIMES IT MAKES ME ENTER AND EXIT AND I CANNOT GET OU...Full ReviewFIVE STAR BEST GAME EVER BUT IT HAS SOME BUGS LIKE I GET STUCK IN THE LADDER IN AIRSHIP ITS MAKE ME GO UP AND DOWN SOMETIMES WHEN I MOVE MY CHARACTER MOVE BUT MY SKIN AND HAT ARE NOT MOVING WITH ME LIKE THERE WERE JUST STICKERS AND WHEN I VENT SOMETIMES IT MAKES ME ENTER AND EXIT AND I CANNOT GET OUT ONLY CAN GET OUT IF METTING AND BODY REPORT AND BAN HACKERS I SAW SOME 100 PLAYER SERVER PLAYERS OUTSIDE THE MAP AND GLITCHED NAME AND ALL SAME COLORS PLZ FIX BUGS AND BAN HACKERS

I give it 4 stars because the new update is email and I cant even play a game or get anyone to join my server but the new maps accessories and stuff are great except the log in. Please remove the log in thing thanks
I really used to love this game coz of people saying sus or him no i am not ur but since you updated the chat its not fun anymore It was so much fun but i dont like it anymore please remove this update and let the game how it was before please
"I hate the speed chat,  you cant even explain yourself and people just vote random people for that,  once speed chat is removed,  Ill be happy. Right now this game is horrible and it sucks."
The game is great and the update is great but the thing is it keeps kicking me out of the players lobby saying your ping went down a single digit which is weird and sometimes it just kicks me out saying network error even though my wifi is good
"Nice game but when the latest update came it destroyed the game(Not too much) I hate the one when you try to type but you cant like that (i hope yall understand what im saying) Please fix it,  thank you"
This game used to be so good before the update. You could just type in anything you wanted to say but now the game picks what you say. There should be an option to change that setting. And please bring back the plague mask
The game was ok at first but now i cant even get in.I have it and cannot play.When i press on the game all i see is a black screen and then it just come out of the game.I use to love the game and spend alot of time playing.It was my favorite game but now i cant even play.
I love this game all though please keep young kids away from it it does includes alot of violence but if your seven and above it is ok now let me tell you the rules there is an imposter role this game is like murder mystery just so ya know now about the imposter role so they are trying to kill all t...Full ReviewI love this game all though please keep young kids away from it it does includes alot of violence but if your seven and above it is ok now let me tell you the rules there is an imposter role this game is like murder mystery just so ya know now about the imposter role so they are trying to kill all the crewmates most of the maps are space including so yeah the crewmates need to do there tasks before the imposter kills them all so yeah MODS CAN BE ADDED there are so much deaths tho and pets
"Black screen wouldnt load,  a spinning green circle at the top left corner. Would give it 0 stars if I could."
Im putting 5 stars but I carry on getting kicked from games and I dont like the new chat update because you cant chat through own speech either its removed or not I dont know because I cant play because I keep getting kicked
"The game ruined its accessibility and easyfulness with account and google play feature. I no more can invite my friends and tell them to hop in my lobby,  they need extra work which ruins everything."
The old one is more good.Remove the quick chat.It makes the game boring and you cannot explain yourself to the others so it is impossible that they will believe you.It is unfair the update makes the game trashy.The creators shouldve just blur the swears instead do a quick chat.
The game is good but the only problem is i only type in chat by the way if you add voice chat in game i give 5 this is very nice if we also make friend list like other games
Used to be really fun. But it has become really boring without text chat Please bring back text chat No text chat is the reason this app is dying To earn more installs an more money you need to bring back text chat or among us will surely be dead very soon
Game has changed sence the new updates used to be fun but the chat is now weird. Game is slowly becoming old and not fun anymore as it used to. not being able to change the username sucks and not typing in chat games becoming worse and worse
I want to say that leaving the beta game is a nightmare it takes a lot of time and I just wanted to play  bet all in one its a good game (

Terrible. I tried to join my friends game with putting the right code and it didnt let me join their game. I had to play as a guest bc i had to put a email which sucks. No wonder this has mostly 13 starts
"I used to play this game,  like this game was mah fav But now,  when i updated this game,  everything changed Like i cant even chat with someone I hate this game now Ugh,  literally i m cursing myself for updating the game "
"I love this game,  but I always disconnect ( and then after disconnecting like 15 times it says I intentionally disconnected and then I cant play for 4 mins."

This is one of my favorite game in the whole universe even know that you kill people but its really fine and you can make your own map and do the new map its that cool like how can that even happen like every YouTube video like they now play that Airship map
SUPER fun game to play with friends or with anyone. A few ups and downs but overal a fun game. Although the update with the chat was a bit anoying.
"Between my screen being forced off when games start and people bailing at the same time,  lost its touch. Was fun while it lasted Oh yeah and the quick chat is cancer."
"Hello,  can you please add a map called submerge and if the imposter sabotages the players have to wear a oxygen mask,  And you can drown if the impostor pushes you underwater,  I would love this to exist,  and I love your design of this game 3"

This sucks it wont let me log in and I see that everyone else has that problem too because everyone else has the same stupid nicknames and the same stupid chat. This game used to be good but now it sucks. waste of space for your device dont bother downloading

"Update,  chat works now you just need to make an account,  thing seems good again,  just that little kids ruin it by thinking it tinder they should fix tomy glitches and add friends buttons that keeps us temporary friends"
Ok so it keeps saying something about the pings not being received by the remote. All i am trying to do is play a simple 4 player server and I CANT EVEN GET INTO A LOBBY WITHOUT THAT BUG Please fix this
"Honestly,  people keep chatting about Quickchat. Are people really that dumb They could simply add an account and boom. You got it. _ And if you didnt figure that out,  dang,  just search it up in like youtube or something. Appreciate stuff like that in those moments. "
its a really good game its really fun plus there barely even any ads the airship map made the game so much better the update of 15 players lobby made it even better also new colors. I Recommend to install this game because all of people are installing this game and honestly this game is really fun
"Very good game,  but if I try to join a public server or make a server it dosent work and says no public servers avalible its very annoying please fix it cause I truly love this game."
"I use to love this game Soo Soo much but now the hole quick chat thing just ruins the hole intire game,  And you cant change you name. Those 2 things need to be fixed but other then that this is an awesome game."

"Not bad at all. But it has many bugs. Which should be fixed by Innersloth. Sometimes,  the game becomes very slow in Airship Map. So,  I am rating this 3 stars. Thanks."
"Use to be fun but now it feels forced I think the worse addiction of this game is having to pick ya words free chat is better because I dont feel limited to what Im trying to say,  and Im not good with names colors are way better"
Vest game in the world. But there are some leggings. And please add bengali and hindi language. I want a new vent style. Please give the pets in free and only joust some skins in free. Please.
A very good game it has many good things... It gives players new updates. Awsome game. But I only suggest one thing to the among us team that now you have started free chat but people are using innoppropriate words so do something..
This game is ok but its a bit boring if you are not the impostor. Also i hope in the future there are more skins that look like meme characters and all of them are free. And of course more cooler maps

I love this game you can play it with youre friends but the new update was really annoying like its are hard to use a chat but its really fun Soo Im gonna give a 2 star pls change the chat and bring the old one ( Sorry for wrong grammar)
Quick chat is horrible. Been trying to play for over an hour  it keeps telling me no servers are available when I try to host  when i try to join a game theres NOTHING. This was my favourite game. Please fix

The only reason for 1 star is the latest update. It ruined among us. U now need to manually go and find the words u want 2 write instead of typing. Bring the old typing system back.

I used to love this game a lot I would play with friends but with the update you cant talk anymore unless you have a account even if you get a account you cant chose what you say this was the best game ever please change it back you ruined the game when it got really popular

Love the game. Please launch submerged map of phone too. And there is no text chat so it is hard to clear anybody in the game etc. And we cant type our own names. Please let us do so in the game. Thank you innersloth for releasing such a amazing game
really cool but I have a idea What if there is a chat that is meant for the imposters so they can communicate 
its great but i dont like how the chat talking has been taken away and you cant choose ur name i really dont like them if you could change that that would be amazing really amazing so 1 star for now until you put that back in the game also for some reason the airship map is so laggy
"Rereviewing after about 10 months. Changed from 2 stars to 5 stars because they did fix A LOT of bugs and also added a few small useful features. Now it feels like a good,  proper game."
"This games moderation is horrible,  I was in a match I called a meeting because I wanted people to see me do a visual task... AND THEN GOT BANNED BY THE GAME FOR HACKING. I WAS 100 NOT HACKING This game has flaws. But other than that its an ok game."
The game had one bug that when a meeting then suddenly a report come and I see when the report comes we are all dead pls fix this bug I will give you 5 stars when you fix this
Heyyo innertrash Fix the disconnect issue Whenever i come in i keep disconnected and its said i intentional disconnected how is that possible Well i give 3 star if yu fix that

I dont play this game anymore because of the hackers and the community hackersmodders and the account system it is good to have security but having no chat except from navigation chat if you sign up for it you can have your chat freely
The game is very laggy. There are many glithces i.e the game automatically end without starting and we get the defeat message. We cant type quickly in the chat because of that option thing. And we cantt message without using it which I think is bad. Please improve this game.
Great game I just want to suggest something like adding new function on among us like we can add some friends and the limit of friends is at least 200 and we can search our favorite server
I think you should add one more free mode which is hide n seek cause in every game crewmates are saying lets play hide n seek so please add hide n seek in it and please unlock all the pets and skins in among us so that evryboxy can enjoy skins and pets last things last please ban all the hackers or...Full ReviewI think you should add one more free mode which is hide n seek cause in every game crewmates are saying lets play hide n seek so please add hide n seek in it and please unlock all the pets and skins in among us so that evryboxy can enjoy skins and pets last things last please ban all the hackers or cheatrs because the hack and then are not able to play the one most scary is GAREBARE you should surely ban it

Its used to be a really fun game Untill.........the update Now with a dozen more lag Paid stuff for name change Doesnt even work on low end devices Its sooo Baad now If you can just undo the update please....
The app use to be brilliant but now the editors has made the game terrible by adding quick chat please remove that small update or at least make it optional to make it easier to explain when questioned of where you were in a meeting
I like this game its so interesting and fun new taske and new color are awesome but only one problem is there we can chat freely but its so interesting game so make sure you need to download and rate 5 stars
Its my favorite game for moblie And its really fun I also like it because you cant spend money on it to get any advantage. Im editing since you cant have free chat and costom name anymore the game is bad now. Probibly not gonna play again.
Its great game but theres one problem being imposter is impossible if I play 20 times I might get one chance to be imposter thats why I give 4 star

If you wanna be popular again (among us) you must update to the old version. Keyboard is the problem (not practical). No wonder among us is not popular again.
It is so awesome you should download it is almost like killing people and they dont know that youre the one whos killer. But only sometimes you the killer. Not all the time sometimes it is other people thats the killer

Definitely an amazing game but maybe make it where there is a lot more colors because sometimes we all have to be a color we dont like and thay gets kind of annoying at times.
the game is good I recommend playing it but I gave it 4 stars because sometimes I have good internet and it disconnect me its really annoying but the game is good specially when its played with your friends
It was a some until the new update. The chat update is awful Im extremely late on this but idc. Also the new map is terrible. Who ever made up this idea needs to give is back the old among us. You ruin you game. Dont reccomend for anyone. I would gives this 0 stars if I could
"Slow wont let me type in the chat,  it dosent need to be updated. I even made an account and still wont work. And I dont see the option in settings."
Ok well a very fun game but why do you need to sign in with an account i mean its not really going to do anything but being able to play online and create lobbys so yeah good game but it still has the quick chat thing wich isnt anything good on my opinion try it for yourself
Please return the chat system to the old one. The chat system sucks. We want the old chat system back And its so laggy
I deleted this game one time now am giving it one more chance fix the talking it used to be so much fun to now the talking on this game sucks fix it or I will be deleting it again thank you for your time
The game is good.But the new update has ruined the game.You cannot type what you have to but you can fix this by login into your google account.If you are younger not 18 then you have to change your date of birth in the game.So then you can chat freely.
This game is a ever since u guys changed the chat the game became boring i can barley explain where the imposter is or where the body is its hard to communicate like that plz fix it
I liked this game but the new update ruined game you cant chat freely and you cant pick a user name and the new map is absolutely laggy other than the new update its a great game
This game used to be good with chat but now its just boring and you have to click around to put in whatever is on there you cant defend yourself right if you cant type. Please do add chat again
They fix a bug create 5 more. With this last update my game keeps closing because of the server . It had been working fine until the update.... Server kicking ppl off .. frustrating
Its kinda good game but please fix the chat. You cant type whatever you wanna say. When i left among us and open it it just closed and i have to uninstall it. Please fix the glitchs
I like the game but as soon as i logged in i played it and then a few 2 hours later it asks me for a account and it just froze my screen.I like the old way of meetings. Please go back to the old ways of among us
This is a good game but there are a lot of bugs like I dont even use kindle fire and I still get kicked out and when you try to sign in u cant plus some players have mods that make them the imposter I would really like it if u can make so I can play the game plsssd
It Was Such A WONDERFUL Game until this dumb update that made it so you cant use chat or make your own gamertag This use to be such a fun game but now its so hard to do anything Pls fix this so we can use chat and make our own gamertag
This game was fun a lot in 2020 but this Account system and quickchat ruined everything and the new colours update wouldve been great if there were gold n silver type coloursbut this game needs ajustsments for sure
It is amazing 5 stars for everything the game does not lag that much and the game has lots of details in the maps and the animason is amazing
Love it me and my friend play this game but my is among us is crash because than i make a game it full screen is black and than i join it going circle circle circle but free play it ok and fast chat my friend do not like for me it ok i guess and i am downloading it in my laptop
"This game is great,  but you really need to add a way to add friends. If you added these things,  you would get a 5 star from me."
Thank you developers for listening to the communities concerns. I appreciate the fact you responded and tweaked many bugs that I highlighted in my previous rating. I did logg in again and I was able to set up my account properly and use the chat.
AWSOME FINALLY FIXED GOOGLE ACC PROBLEM THIS IS NOW AWSOME but a small problem is that free chat doesnt work even with an acceditit does you need to go into the settings before you join a match on the homescreen then go into the second folder.
Its literally a place where perverted little kids go to be perverts in a room... Sex talk... Kinky talk.... Everything but gaming goes on here. If you are a decent parent youll delete the app off your childs phone before they get stolen by a predator. Just my advice take it how you will.
The app updated and I wasnt able to talk in chat. Well I Uninstalled and reinstalled the app and I lost my witches hat I loved that hat.. I want it back if possible
"Great game,  but please change quick chat to say a characters color instead of their name,  it makes it much more complicated for people that use it."
This game is so much fun I cant believe youre doing it you can kill people in the pasta and stuff like yeah Ive been watching mommy for decades and all the monkeys that got created a couple years ago so yeah I like a new one that you just created but I dont even know who created so you could you...Full ReviewThis game is so much fun I cant believe youre doing it you can kill people in the pasta and stuff like yeah Ive been watching mommy for decades and all the monkeys that got created a couple years ago so yeah I like a new one that you just created but I dont even know who created so you could you tell me And without all the way I like the game
"Used to love this game but after the update its ruined,  I didnt receive any e mail to unlock the game features,  quick chat is useless its confusing. Please make the changes otherwise it is rly boring to play"
I used to love this game but now it is so boring we cant chat and we cant write anything in chat box .Please its my request bring our old among us game . How many people are with me please support bring that old version back and its rating will also increase edit thanks for updates
"So when I downloaded the app it was a couple days until I actually played it witch was today,  I was a crew mate and blah blah blah,  it didnt let me chat for some reason.

And the update wasnt really bad but also wasnt really good,  I like the new hats and colors but you cant type your name in anymore you have to randomize it. Theres not really any other problems with the game for now,  and Im not for sure if its a glitch or not for the chatting problem. So for now Im gonna give it 2 stars."
i love to play this game. on my other tablet it worked great but i got a new tablet and now the screen is just black i wait but the same thing maybe im not waiting long enough
i did two stars cuz the game keeps kicking me out even tho am the host and have people in the game and when i create a other game and it starts it still kicks me out for no reason
The app used to be nice until you added the feature where you cant type anything in chat but overall this game is nice.
"Had to edit the 5 star review,  this game is literally trash. It doesnt works,  cant find a match and even host it. Please revive the game"
"What has done with this game. Back in 34 months ago I liked the game. Now with update its going down. We cant change our name. Cant chat with our words,  why Im never playing it again."
"Im having trouble connecting and the chat box became complicated. This became one of my worst experience,  this is the worst  developers too."
Among us is very nice game. You all made it very much fun thats why I will give you 3 star if you change the system of the chat its confusing and if you lemm change my name. If this ubdate will come that only I will rate it 5 star till then it will be 3 star only
"Why cant i play as a guest When i touch to go private or anything it will load and it will take so long,  fix this please. I can only play is the practice,  (When you have no wifi)"
I havent played among us in a long time but the fact that I cant type words freely and easilly acuse the imposter makes my experience alot worse but more colors and more people per room is a nice addition.
"All I got to say is just R.i.p. It was a fun game for a while but then the game update came. I cant chat freely,  I cant walk without gliching,  and I even got to download extra junk to play this game."
Cool game but i spend 1.99 for a skin and pet i byed all the pets i hat whene pepole call metings so early I hate itiiiiitittitiittitit so like can i reall y play the game but still a cool game pls make the chat back to.

I dont like the look of the game you cant chat anything you want and pls turn it back to the old version of the game its better
There should be a translator so if you only understand english and someone is typing in Japanese you will understand and it will translate Japanese for them

Great game Would recomend No problems at all. Its confusing once u start but u will get the hang of it Really good game.
The quick chat thing is the worst I hate this update back then this game was so much fun now its not every game always get ruined they think they are doing good when in reality they are not.

So,  I want you to add the server description And you should add new colors olive,  magenta,  charcoal,  caramel,  bubblegum and more hope you like my idea Innersloth Byeeee ) "
I use to love this game and the recent update but it started taking a while to load and my phone has enough space but it just doesnt work. I also tried to uninstall and reinstall it but nothing works.
This game is really fun but sometimes its his glitchy and I dont like that maybe fix it I dont know who created this game but this game is starting to get dumb
This is a really good game and I love it  but when I try to do quick chat into free or quick chat it doesnt come so thats why id give it four star.
"This game is so fun I love it,  I just wish we could type again without having to sign in. Altough sometimes it can cause arguments and that I dislike."
"THE GAME IS AMAZING You get to so many tasks and when your imposter you get to sabtoge, kill, vent and its a fun strategy game you can even go live on twitch stream and play with your friends.I recommend the game"
"I think this game is fine. It had its up and downs with the chat,  But it lags a lot and before be dinnt have to sign in now we do.. But over all i think this gameis fine."
"This game used to be my fav. But now ,  after the update is not that great,  as it used to be. And it is also lagging a lot. Thats why I am giving it only 2 stars."
"It may fun but... I dont know how to change name,  its always updating and sometimes i load pretty slow,  i like the updates but i just dont like the names that is given,  some of the names are inpproiate for kids and todlers,  so please can you make it easy to change the names..."
I love the game but my only problem is this new update were ur unable to chat properly its kinda laggy but other than the chat thing its pretty fun so please fix the chat thing please
this game is amazing but it somtimes have glitches like we all get killed by no one and it disconnects me when i play but although it is a great game i would love to give it 5 stars if you would fix the glitches
tysm for fixing the bugs. but another thing. is it from my device or the among us when Im starting to play is they always have black screen and I cant play at all.
I quit this game from like 34 months cuz of the stupid auto chat system i enter now and its still with no free chat Bring back free chat the game is unplayable without it
"This is a great online game, it decides if you are ither a crewmate or an inpostor, its also cool because you can play with friend and play mini games called tasks to win as a crewmate."
I am in love with this game because it is so fun and entertaining but I only have one problem and it is I dont like the quick chat I would like to chat on my own and type in the things I want to type because its frustrating with the quick chat But this game Is very fun and I never get bored of it...Full ReviewI am in love with this game because it is so fun and entertaining but I only have one problem and it is I dont like the quick chat I would like to chat on my own and type in the things I want to type because its frustrating with the quick chat But this game Is very fun and I never get bored of it I can play it as long as I can and I will never be bored

Love the update .Now there is a bit of a problem every time I am in the airship and I m an imposter I glitch and I m superslow and sometimes freeze up sooo plz fix this up.
Fun but this game used to be so much fun and used to be able to write freely and have whatever name u want exc but now its not as fun
"Hi there (Among Us) devs,  your game has unplayable bug where i cant even create a game or even join a public match,  i signed in and it still dont work. This bug will delegate to your game to be terrible."
"I made it 4 stars because it does not have free chat and,  does not let you have a free username,  unless you get play games and,  do email. Please fix it or I will leave 3 or 2 stars on my review."
This game is soooo fun to play no ads and you can change your color and everything but one thing I dont like about the game is that in the beginning I was imposter 3 times and from there Ive just been creww mate
The chat upgrade made the game overall really boring and its hard to communicate and its really annoying. There are also many other people saying the same thing so I hope the developers are gonna change this
Among us was one of my favorite games but ever since the new updates it is very laggy. The new quick chat update is very hard to use and find what to say before getting voted off.
I dont really like the update on were you cant type what you want to say you have to choose an amoung us phrase  and i dont think its fair that some people could get the imposter 2 times in a row and some could be playing for hours and not get it
I like among us. It is fun and relaxing. I just dont like the new age thing. As I am under 13 I cannot type my own username or type my own messages in the game. Youre probably not going to but please remove this feature and I will give 5 stars if so. Thank you.
Two stars because it wont allow players with quick chat in the same room as free chat. And because of this it isnt fun anymore. Plz fix this.

"The game used to be good,  but please remove the restrictions for older players. I had to uninstall and reinstall just to type. And now there are so many bugs and the Airship map is trash."
The game used to be really fun but some of the updates are kind of useless like the game wants more attention and doesnt really care about what people would like more.Plz add some better updates like new modes or something not just new tasks and new maps.Its kind of boring.

"The new update is horrible,  cant even chat freely without an account and it wont even let me make an account I used to love the game now its just bad I will raise my rating if it gets fixed."
Its very fun u can play it with your friends very cool game but whenever I try to buy skins I didnt see it on the laptop and u need to be kinda rich to buy pets and skins so its all fine but I also really want a skin thats why Im giving it 4 star
I use to play among us all the time but now it is so hard to speak In chat so deleted it and now I got it back I think if they fix it it will be way better
Its a very good game but the updates arent that good like i would like the npquik chat to be removed and it also disconnects me all the time and its so annoying

"I love this game,  but the new update made me change my mind about it. Without signing in,  it wont let you write your own name,  and you cant type anything that comes from your mind. Please change this version."
"Game works,  and I appreciate the new content. It just seems to be a problem that I cant play Airship without the game lagging out. Pretty cool either way."
Among us us a fun game to play with friends but the new update is annoying. I hate the new map and when you finish voting a player you can only stay in one map and it really annoys me. But really I enjoy this game
"I like this game especially when I am the impostor. The new colours, visor curve and 15 player lobby make it more nice. Just one suggestion,  please add mods."
The new update along with the new map(Airship) is a lot better thanx. By the way signing in lets you free chat. I dont have problems with this game so far
"Its became awful now, i installed if after a very long period thought it could have get better but it was a huge disappointment present game lacks flexibility,  I miss the older version.."

The game used to be great until they added the new chat system. I wont be playing again until its back to the original. The game was great but now it just feels like youre playing with bots. So sad.
I just love it and the controls but I only have one problem... I cant type to other players.. fix that issue Thank you

Was good at first but once they added auto chat and having to sign in to turn it off is dumb because if someones says Im sus I cant explain myself or say anything in defense all I could say is (__) sus so fix that
I loved this game but it has a bug where as soon as I join a match it gets me off the app and I got off and back on but that did not work
After the last update with different colors among us is way cooler but the down side is it can get hard to navigate the quick chat feature and its hard to remember all of the new colors and please make a higher  if getting the imposters thank you for making this game

I like this game but when I press public it never came. It loads forever even though I updated it and I. Cant create my. Own game and. Can you please fix it I can play forever
"Bruh the chat sucks. Like I want to say like hey,  I saw blue come out of vent in Admin,  but instead of that I can only saw Blue,  blue,  blue."
"I love Among Us,  but now the app is linking me to a site that asks for either a credit card number or a social security number to verify that I am an adult. This is stupid and malicious and I refuse to agree to that. Dont bother with this app,  just buy the official game."
I love this game its really fun but there are a few glitches like sometimes you have go down a ladder then you get stuck it mainly happens on the meeting room ladder plus please make 2 or 3 pets hat skins free please
Such a worat game ever This version is not good i cannot chat normal. And when the meeting is ove i cannot walk I need to wait so i can walk FIX IT
This is so good game. This game have so Fun. But in the New version if we dont have any account then we cant type any Message or our Name.
AFTER NEW UPDATE THIS IS GAME IS NOW UNPLAYBLE . WHEN I TRIED TO JOIN PUBLIC SERVERS IT SAY this game is already started AND WHEN I TRIED TO JOIN 115 SERVER IT SAYS AGAIN SIRUSLY I hope you fix it soon... Thank you
Quick chat ruined the game because most people dont use it so I either get voted out for no reason or have no idea who the imposters are. And most people that use quick chat say random things that dont help. Update Now I cant play with friend that has quick chat only.
Its a Fun game but please fix the chat were getting many requests for the chat please fix it in the upcoming update please I cant directly communicate with the crew in the game its quite hard to chat so please innersloth were begging you
"So I played the game again hoping just to have a good time but most of the public lobbies are full of toxic people now just insulting eachother over just being there,  the only way to actually have fun and not be insulted when playing among us is probably with your friends on privite games."
I really like this game. It removes all my tension and problems and through this game I have many new friends. Thank you so much innersloth for making this game and all the best for the new updates you will bring to the players of this game. Thanks a lot again 
The game got fixed You can type whatever you want again Since it got fixed its waaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy better than it was when the airship came out.

Its a really good game but left with 1 update the update is when a host starts a game so it should show a table with some chits on the table then if we click on use it should pick it up and then its the same
I like this so much I play it so much but now your thinking I didnt give 5 stars well when I join the beta there is no submerged map which is a little weird
First of all before update this game is very interesting but after update I dont like it before date you can write what do you want after update you cant write what do you want so before update among us is very interesting.

The game is fun and is played with played with friends since the vent clean task it is easier and with 15 player lobbies more friends can join the lobby it was a really great idea to have new colors and are the best colors I seen in my life.

It was good before airship map came because I cant type freely. Having an account is good but atleast have an option to type instead of choosing from a bunch of options.
"I love this game its amazing and i love all the maps. Its an awesome game and deserves a second edition,  more maps,  and more roles to make it even better."
All Ladders has a lag in airship please fix i have struggle with lag storms . 2 please add another map i really had fun with the airship . 3 is among us a chickenthey look soo small .4 which idea had made among us
"Very good game I just downloaded this And looks good,  1. Its better to play this with friends,  2. I used a voice chat app to make friends and have fun,  3.funni bc there no arms,  anyways AWESOME GAME YES SIR 10000000000010"
"Its OK. U just are scammed sometimes,  as they usually kick you out of the account and never let u long in. Also very glitchy. Also gives u a false sense of accomplishment as the report function does not work. Quick Chat is still stupid..."
So great game in general but just today all the servers crashed. I have no doubt that you will fix it please notify me when it is fixed.
5 stars but there is a bug where when a emergency meeting is called everyone whos alive is reported dead when we are actually alive please fix this glitch
"This game is pretty good just sign in in your account and go to change quick chat to free chat,  but theres a bug that if I report it will start to report everyone that not dead I dont know but the imposter wins or crew becuz everyone just leave after that bug happened"
I used to spend hours playing this game but after the updates tilt it has been boring and one more thing when I try to start a game the screen just turn black
I love this game so much And you guys should actually Have this app more updated like we should play offline with other players then being online with others players that would be cool for me to be recommended.
"This game was absolutely addictive on 2020 and 2019. But now Everyone is DUMBER than before. They blame random people,  And when your a guest you cant say tasks like scanning. This game is garbage."
This game is amazing but the only problem is that you cant change your name or map while in game. Other than that this game is perfect. If you see someone named INNERBEAR Please communicate on among us )
"I come back to this game months later only to find out that theyve taken away the manual chat function. Doesnt even make sense to play it anymore,  its soo dull"
This game is very much fun but i gave it a 3 bc it is also strict on what you say and if you intentionally leave a game multiple times then it puts you on a 5 min wait so u cant play for 5 mins which kinda sucks
"Most is good but the chat box made me go insane its the only thing I can use on pc pt mobile you ruined it i cant say who is sus I cant say , eems its sad. Nice change. ( edit) this is for Google family link my son wants to make an account but he cant from family link so Im sad"
The game is really nice to play but I never finish a game. I always get booted out from the server when am playing and that I really annoying. You guys should work on your services
"This game used to be fun,  but with the updates it has gotten boring. If you are new to the game it will probabbly be fun but if you played the game before then it will be kinda boring."
"I used to love playing and watching people play this game but when among us developers thought to add new updates the game have changed and no longer fun to play,  better download other among us copys since they are like old among us"
"It was Very fun game,  but now it doesnt even work . I cant find a match and cant even host it. They should release Among Us 2 now."
I agree with tonberry this used to be a very fun puzzle game but the fact that Intersloth added quick chat is very frustrating and the fact that you cant change the chat settings is extra frustrating

"I am speechless....it is literally awesome... The colors are literally elegant Just one thing,  I am not liking the chat...we cannot talk freely or explain about the accusations and the proof....I cannot sign up too...so would you ming fixing the chat "
"I love the game and all but the new quick chat feature is weird.  but now when I join a game,  my screen is just greyblack and the Loading Additional Assets takes forever and like nearly two hours.."
It was beautiful but this period When I became Impostor taking me out of the server immediately I dont know why I tried updating the game but I cant wish to solve the problem as soon as possible or I will have to delete it
"all though it is a great game but i has 2 cons,  1. the Room closed due to inactivity makes this game feel impatience and 2. i cant play this game offline,  even when there is go offline"
Tried to join. Kept glitching and saying body reported and then after 5 games of this exact thing I apparently couldnt join another because Id left them. Fix your game. Used to be good.
So I was playing this game and its says it cannot sign in into my account and I cant chat and its very hard to use the quick chats and I also recommend to add friends And pls on next update remove the sign in
"Amazing but how do u get pets,  skins different hats Also,  why on earth did u take the chat and put on with options Fix that or I uninstall"
"Full of Cheaters,  makes the game unplayable,  server is broken,  settings is awful,  should be a potential game yet developer cant even fix a minor error,  disappointed."
"THE ORIGINAL WAS PERFECT updated the game and it was a bad update,  Now you hardly get the imp and are given words andO tbh it is quite dry DONT DOWNLOAD IT"
"I LOVED the original,  but the new chat features suck,  and totally ruined it for me. The original was one of the best games ever but now...."
Good game. Like the new features. But please add an exit button or exit option. Have to kill task to end the game.
This game is so good but this game has too many bugs and glitches too Yesterday I played this game and in 1 match 30 times a body reported And if you will start a game for just 10 it will show you blank screen and then the game will start A request to developers pls mantain this game
So this game is amazing but the chat is really weird and you need to do this weird thing with the scroll wheel and I cant even say what I want to say
The update is good but the new graphic and character moving is not that good . Before animation and graphic was much better If u can chenge in future then it will be good.. Thanks u among us team..
Its a good game but its way over rateid. Most of the time it glichis for me. I find the best way to play it is to play on a Nintendo switch.

Old Version Is Good Because In Previous Version We Can Talk Aur Type Manually During Disccusion. And In New Version We Unable To Talk Manually And It Is Also Slow. Please Upgrade Into Previous Version. If You Will Fix This Issues I Will Promote Your Game Without Any Money.
"I dont like this game anymore. When someone accuses you,  you cant really describe what saw. Chat update sucks and so does the name how you cant use any of our creative names. I know it keeps people from saying inappropriate things and stuff but this game is dead."
Its a good game and I am very happy to play it but there is a problem of not sending and taking friend request so please fix the problem or not there is a problem in the game please fix it
I love the game but i cant play with my friends or my sister because we all had a defferent version. We all checked to see if we had to update among us but we couldnt so i hope that gets fixed
So among us should ad a add friend button cause other multilayer games have add friend exept this one so please add a ad friend button and by the way great game everything is great just the adding friend please.
I used to like the game at 3 stars but since the update I hated the game I wont play untill they fix the chat and other things about the new update. But they fixed it so again

This game has been lagging alot and u cant even write specifically what u need to write and u cant change ur name like how am I supposed to deal with that among new updates suck"
It is very nice but we cant play imposer and we cant message with another player it is easy but it is nice........................ By among us player
"I love this game and I play it always. I just wish if the impostor could chat together it would be so amazing . Like if the impostor could chat together they could kill more and win, but otherwise i love this game so much"
It was an amazing game back then...now there is no chatting option...We can choose between the responses nd nothing else... Please add the free chat option again...
It was fun until the update happened and I could not type so when they fixed the update they only fixed it for Apple products. And Sumsung products were stuck with the update.
"Pretty good game,  the airship update took a little longer to release than i would of thought but other than its a cool game ]"
"I really love the game,  dont tell the graphics are not good bzc its unique in its own way but its keep disconnecting from the servers,  how can i even play please fix or just launch stable among us 2."
This game is cool and I just wanna say that this game can t even let me in the server because it keeps disconnecting can you pls fix this and I will know your information
I have it 3 stars because before it was great but now my screen goes blank when i try and host the game and it wont let me play join a game either so it is not fun please fix it. 
"I like this What wonderful cremates and imposters It so optional Pls download the game Its so fun with crewmates,  imposters,  anything Mostly time for 10 minutes "
This game is nice but it hangs a lot every time i joined the game is i. Automatic leave just plz fixed this problem the old among us was better 
"The quick chat ruins everything. You cant even say gg,  why,  requests for settings,  or explain wait you saw thourghly. Theres also no way to turn it off"
"This game has so many problems. 1. Why we have to sign in to use FREE CHAT 2. and I think there should be 5 IMPOSTOR NOT 3,  BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE.(I dont even want to give ONE STAR)"
"This Game Was Better Before The Release Of The Mothership,  because having to have accounts to play,  i understand that thats the way to ban hackers,  but it has gave guest acc lack of communication,  please Allow everyone to type in chat"
I love the game. The reason I gave 1 star is there are too many hackers in among us. They spoil the game experience. Please ban all hackers I.D. And when we enter a room we get banned most of time. Please fix that also.
This game is good.... But i have some issues which is everytime i enter a room i disconnectwut the heck And other players are hecker They know whos the impostor and whos not Which is very annoying Their snitch They tell everyone whos the impostor LMAOOO This game is annoying you ...Full ReviewThis game is good....

this game is awesome the auto correct is SO annoying but i had quick chat but now i dont you know why not many people know this but you go into settings any way great game you get to be imposter and crew mate
I gave it a 4 star cause dont like the way to chat. I like the og way to chat where you have to type and not some thing.
I used to love this game until the new chat and accounts came in.And its very LAGGY they shadow block my whole screen that i cant even play i hate this game now.
"Its a good game overall but how do you speak without using the menu Because Ive been voted Sus because I wasnt saying anything. Can someone please help with this issue Im having Other from that,  its really fun to play with people you know"
It used be be a very fun game until the update came...the chats thing is very difficult to figure out..i want old Among us back
Ok this game is good but I saw almost all of the worst reviews they were complaining that among us quick chat is the worst but it is not you guys need to download Google play games do that it will work and they even say you to do that it is the best game in 2021 it came back with a striking combat
After the update the game becomes more enjoyable but one problem for all of us who plays amoung us is we cant have free chats like we have a quick chat in which we cant write by our own and in free chat we can write by ourselves if u free the quick chat to free chat then I will give 55 but for no...Full ReviewAfter the update the game becomes more enjoyable but one problem for all of us who plays amoung us is we cant have free chats like we have a quick chat in which we cant write by our own and in free chat we can write by ourselves if u free the quick chat to free chat then I will give 55 but for now I m giving 45 stars thnku hve a good day bye bye 
I have good feeling about this game and maps are very good but 1 problem that is name because if players login only the name will be their wish other than that all clear
"This game is great ,  I just installed this a week ago because my friend had recommended it to me,  and I found the game entertaining and fun. Totally recommend it to others"
literally I loved this game before the update its because it has just been disgusting to not chat properly and what about the sign in and we cannot even name ourself with our choice its just unnacaptable sorry but the worst it has become and lost most of their users FIX IT please
new update completly ruined the whole game. no free chat anymore so you take 2 minutes to find out what to press to say admin only to be called sus.
"at first i was so excited for the update ,  but after the update the game kinda sucks . the first thing i hate is the quick chat like i cant say whatever i want and its like kinda hard to like only choose the words that are written in the quick chat and i cant make friends anymore . plus i want to be...Full Reviewat first i was so excited for the update ,  but after the update the game kinda sucks . the first thing i hate is the quick chat like i cant say whatever i want and its like kinda hard to like only choose the words that are written in the quick chat and i cant make friends anymore . plus i want to be able to write my name the way i want . the update just sucks ,  can we just go back where we can type whatever we want in the chat and also write our name the way we want to . please change the update"
"Honestly the old versions better,  I mean for 7 rounds I knew the imposters and when I tried saying it,  I couldnt because its literally impossible with the new update,  honestly now I understand why this fell from the top chart"
It used to be way better but know as soon as I start every game I disconnect and no matter what I cant play I dont recommend this game unless it doesnt disconnect every time I join. (
"I dont like the new update,  cuz needs google play games and mine always stops working,  plus you need to pay to make an account which I do not like,  also,  quick chat is very boring,  make The game be like the old one"
I will give it 5 stars but no because when this update was released it was a big mess.The task and the ship are great but the thing that is not great is that u cant put whatever name or whatever in the chat and ITS ANOYYINGso please change that PLEASE
I love this game its my favorite game I wish I was every where can you make a among 2 3 4 5 That would be cool the updates are amazing too  This game is awesome and amazing next update will be great probably
"Really,  a great game,  luv it,  but I have a few suggestions... imposters should be able to disguise as a cremate,  and no quick chat,  its annoying sry"
I have an idea for the game for the RHM skin if you kill with the skin on the the player you kill turns to dust becuse you used the laser. and is you dont have is and you use the gus the top part to the player is at the end of the room the the player got killd at. and lastly if you get if the impost...Full ReviewI have an idea for the game for the RHM skin if you kill with the skin on the the player you kill turns to dust becuse you used the laser. and is you dont have is and you use the gus the top part to the player is at the end of the room the the player got killd at. and lastly if you get if the impostor brakes you neck the the body will stil be hole but you are alive for 3 seconds and the you drop.
game is unplayable unless on wifi...I can do everything on my phone from streaming to uploading things on cell service but cant play among us unless on wifi
"The game is amazing,  After the creators fixed the auto chat its better then before I can actually play the game and talk to others online."
"Best game ever No ads,  no hackers,  this game is so much fun and its good at killing time off. Edit now I cant edit my name or even chat wo quick chat Im uninstalling until they fix this"
It was better before updates. The game killed its damn self. Why should I make an account just to play the game when I never had to before. The game isnt worth how much you have to do to get it.
"The game would be way better if we could what type what we wanted to say. This game is hopeless,  glitches still havent been fixed. Overall this game is terrible."
I like this game very well but there was one problem it was difficult to chat please fix this problem
Before among us was good but now they control what we say we have to press buttons which is annoying. Innersloth u better change it back to normal chat and where we can type r names because the new update is stupid.
Was good until you needed an account as you cant play the game properly without one. My parents refused to use their credit card number to verify so I just uninstaled it eventually.
I love this game but i cant change my name and i cant chat freely. but you just need to sign in to chat freely and change name. Thank you for the new update the best thing at the new update is The new map Airship thanks innersloth

Anyway it fun tho and personly I think that it should be fixed thanks for reading
The chat update sucks you cant even type freely and make bonds like for instance I made a really great friend on among us before the update. You also cant choose your own name. I used to have ALOT of fun but now its just boring
the game is so fun but i have a bad thing 1. i cant press the button when i saw the imposter vent 2. i cant buy the skin 3. i cant press the report button can you fix this
This game is so fun its so good i cant even stop playing I love new updates Added new tasks and colors They might be confusing the new colors and this is so fun more tasks Many tasks i want some 7 new tasks in maps I need more tasks Its so fun i love this
The way that us players are limited to express ourselves in chat is ridiculous the chat is the only thing that makes the game fun cause you can feel the expression in the players but now I cant so I hate it
This is an amazing game that helps connect people during the pandemic but you should try to make 4 or 5 imposters so more people can get the chance to play and to keep up with the number of crewmates
"It was a very fun game untill the new update. The colors and maps are good but the chat and the name are just.....SPEECHLES I would love the old amongus with the new map and color, items. Pls concider this Innersloth. The game have become worse."
"Awsome game Should add a new pet Examples  Astronaut Cat  Astronaut dog or alien cat,  Edit  i might sound childish that time,  but today,  the SUGOMA is really different,  the chats are making it boring,  its a deadgame now"
"I love this game,  even though sometimes it crashes and lags,  still a very fun game to play Keep the updates and new maps"

"Changed my review because they brought chat back. It would be good if there was an option to only play with other adults or something but as it is,  its good"
I love how you can clean the vents in a characters in like the emergency meeting button is changed and theres new colors and you can see whos dead and also I love how tiya is a thing so you can voice chat with people in among us

I Love This Game so Much I play It 247 I love the new Colours And new tasks But The only problem Is The chat system I Just would rather Have The Normal Chat. Please Try to get it back to normal. Overall This Game Is My Favorite
I loved this game untill you mad the game talk for us. I love how me and my freinds could say what we wanted but now we cant . i wish it could go pack to normal.
really good game it was entertaining wish that they added back the free chat so you can actully talk to eachother but other than that it was good
"I loved the game before the new update,  but about three or four months ago Isaw the new update and did not like it. And so i deleted it. But today I am going to retry it and see"
I love the game and the ways the updates do so much but I would just like to say that it would be easier to make a search bar if you want too search up a name.
"Why You making a problem doesnt exist,  you have to return keyboard type IMMEDIATELY,  I from Arab countries and join to my friends in local group and we cant communicate together by our language,  what a disappointedly"
I HATE your new chat update and it makes it so hard to type but it would make it easier if you had the colors instead of the names because if you see someone kill you must find out what the imposters name is and the person they killed.
"Over all its a good game,  I just wish you could write freely.Its hard for some people to click the questions or answers as fast as others."
Sooooo I liked this game until... the update came up ( pls fix that I dont like it and yep I uninstalled this.btw add the free chat back cas lots of people have been complaining my brothers are on USA so we cant chat so we download among us
"I love it and I hope you install it  ) Occasionly,  the characters in the game become pink blobs,  but it still works too"
Its a great app but the new update is kinda Anoyying I understand the quick chat n that but I cant even change my name I have to log on from Google play Pls fix this other than that 3starts have a great daynight idk  Bye
This is a fun and superb game but I want to play this on my iPad ( the iPad 3 ) my iPad only goes up to iOS 9.3.2 and to download among us I need iOS 10. May you please make among us compatible with iOS 8 or iOS 9 please and thank you. Keep up the good work
it loads to the thing when you join the game but when I get to that part it kicks me out of the game (pls see if you can do anything about it for people that cant get on) thank you also I would like to type what say in stead of using the choosing thing

Hacking is too prevalent and can something be done about the kick and ban buttons because I can click them but nothing ever pops up so i cant ban any hackers once Ive discovered them
Its fun and with the new graphics it just looks amazing. If your not imposter its fine the crew can be dumb but just take my advice and say its a good game.
"Wish I could give 0 stars, it asks for a credit card and most people who play this game probably dont have one since theyre kids,  people dont even use the chat anymore, you ruined your own game and please remove this feature Msit"
It is a very good game. The positives are you can chat with new people and complete task. On the other hand it can get boring after playing it for a while
Really good game I like how they added the new colors. The only reason I put four stars is because there are some things wrong with among us.
"This is an awesome game Good Job,  Innersloth for Making such a cool game. Install this game right now This will be an awesome game and you can play and chat with your friends and also with people around the world."
Hey can you please add a feature where you can get rid of the auto chat box its hard for me to talk without clicking it it gets in the way every time I try to send a message.
"This game is great and all but I wish I could give 5 stars but if could have you guys added friend list,  because i made ton friend in among us but could play with again and i dont think am speaking for self only we all have made friends in among and wished u can play with agian"
This is my favorite game when its old but not anymore this game is one of the most popular game too many streamers play this game but know i cant even see play this because of the stupid update so plsssssssss make a new update and plssss  ill rate it 5star 
"This game sucks nowadays. The new chat doesnt let you communicate,  the name restriction is terrible,  and the parent controlls dont make sense. Not to mention all the glitches. Please fix this Innersloth."
"Its great except for the name thing,  why wont it let me change my name as often I put a name in and I want to change it but it wont let me. Bring back normal chat. The new one sucks"
the game is great until recently the game needs to pay for free chat and name its really annoying better fix it cuz its the only reason why we most people stop playing this game
"IT IS GREAT,  but needs to get bugs fixed. I cant join my friends game for some reason Can you fix this please I want to play with my friends (]"

Now i am not playing this game any more like iam playing to lose actully
"It really sucks that you cant type anything. Some bugs that make other players invisible,  which makes it annoying when you get killed by no one _"
Really fun and entertaining. There are some thinga that I dont like but other than that its a really fun game to play
I used to love this game until I COULDNT TYPE ANYTHING in the chatroom . I do wish the chatroom back to as it was . You know like a normal chatroom where people can talk to each other
"Ruined it with the chat limiting update,  yes I understand to protect younger kids but why punish us all  make us sign in. Do what other games do  censor some stuff but not this. No longer playing  probably with uninstall."
It used to be so fun and then they took away your ability to type and controls have gotten a bit goofy and you cant choose your own name. Its gotten boring.
Really fun when you get a good grp going. But the game can be really buggy or glitchy at times. But this is an indie game so some of it is expected
"I give it 5 stars. I really like the game,  but lately theyve been making some really annoying updates,  like quick chat,  and now you cant even choose your own name I hate it But still,  its a fun game."
This is a super fun game Its my favorite though the game is too much about deaf..... so maybe make it a bit more fun.
It used be sooooooo fun . They romoved the chat and now I cant play and its really onying when you explain what happens . Pls add it back your game or your game will lose players.
The game is really nice but I have a problem I cant chat to the other crewmates last time I caught the imposter killing someone I reported it but I couldnt chat so people taught it was a self report so please check it for me please
I dont really like the new speed chat its a lot slower because you have to look for everything so if your being accused and you are teying to tell them who you think it is and it will take nearly a minute
I love the game but its just the auto chat the chat was way more good in 2020 but now the update happened its more boring so pls fix that and I love the player update now it has 1515 players and that soo cool.
This game is awsome but you just need a thing to fix. Plz fix the chatting options to chat. I liked that there are new colours new tasks but fix the chatting. This will make it more interesting 
This game went down so much. I get peolle say innapropiate stuff buy just ban people. Instead u make communication much harder and the sign in is horrible. This game was 5 stars now this went down so bad
"always disconnecting... even my ms good. Edit  come back after many months and its now worse than before ,  cant start the game and i cant download additional files for the update even my internet is good,  i will probably never redownload it again..."
This is nice game I ever in my life such a good game for play and I liked it very much this game looks like a relastic game and everyone can play a game only one mynese point is can give a drees and give a hat for free but the game is really is good and nice to play 
The game is nice the the things I dont like is that you cannot type if players could please be able to type I would be happy another thing is that they choose a name us players we would appreciate if we can write our own name
Terrible ever since they added the new update(quick chat) You can no longer type whatever you want and its stupid and annoying and this game isnt the same its dying so fast and tbh its sad and that is my review
This game is very fun and the new update is pretty cool. At first I wrote a bad review because of the quick chat update but I was soon after able to get to my account and change that.
This game was so fun. Now I am so done with this game. I keep disconnecting and it wont let me choose my own name anymore. Also its so laggy its just this sucks now do not recommend
It was great at first but the new updates where you cant name yourself whenever you want and you cant say what ever you want makes it worse.
"This game is extremely fun,  but for younger ages it can be inappropriate there are a lot of sexual names in the game which are not blocked. Really good game though,  would recommend for ages 13"
It used to be extremely fun but now new way of chatting sucks and has made game difficult to play Bring back the old chat
"Its a great game,  I wont lie but there is a big but. You cant chat unless you give credit card info. Other than that its ok"
This is a great game but people kick me out of lobbys before I even load in. And I havent even done a thing yet. So I give this 4 stars.
I love all the different skins . I also love the different updates but the only thing is when you arent logged in its gives you a name instead of you picking your own name other than that LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE
I used to love this game until the new chat update you Cant freely type ( and you cant make any jokes or genuinely chat with friendsso I uninstalled the app 
"I only hate that the chat doesnt open and it takes so much time to open and then closes itself after it is being opened,  so u cant type and cant defend yourself not cant tell who the impo is,  plz fix this chat bar"
Please get back the old chat system. This chat system is not good.we coud not say any reason if I have seen an impostor I cant tell that who is the imposter.So please get back the old chat system again. Thank you
This game is great and all but since some of the new updates the look of the game looks really bad that is just my opinion.
Given 4 stars because the app is good but it requires alot of data and it dont work over wifi that is why I cant play this game 25 days every month. Pls change the setting of the game so I can play my fav. Game (decrease the usage of data ). Plss
Ok the old version of this game is way better I think its annoying that you cant chat I understand that people swore but just hashtag it like this  its really annoying I hope the old among us comes back..
Not allowing free chat killed the game. Takes too long to type out phrases. This game used to be good. Not anymore.
Edit 1 and 2  I have been waiting for quick chat to be removed. Its so frustrating to have quick chat so can you replace which chat with vc or Clipboard  Thats altleast helpful. If its solved I would give 5 stars.
I used to love this game I made a bunch of plush toys and such but with all the new updates and stuff I went to play today and it wasnt even a single lobby open
"Cleaning the vents will definitely add more closely looking at stuff,  airship Is my favorite no doubt,  and sus is in quick chat. Yes,  ads are ok they arent SUPER obtrusive"
Thanks you Now i can play among us again it doesnt really have alot of bugs now but i like the old among us better thats why i gave it a four. But other than that the game is great love it
This is my favourite game but only 1 problem. We cannot chat in this game we can only select the sentences.
The game is pretty good but the chat system is over complicated and its what made me stop playing as well it restricts asking specific questions i thinck at least add the normal chat back into the game thanckyou
It is the best game. First thing first  the new colours are gorgeous I love them Secondly so many new things like phone and the graphics are amazing Totally recommend it 
"very bad update.. You cant even write your Own Name.. And Cant write a message of what you want.

"The game is fun to play with friends but you disconnect very easily and very often,  it gets very annoying and restricts you from actually being able to play the game to its full potential."

"I played this game in 2020 with my schoolfriends,  and my other friend its really fun But now it sucks we cant create name... About chat is... Kinda fine but The problem for me is name so please fix it and then ill give FIVE STAR,  when not... Im out"
"Game feels like its going backwards. You cant freely type in the chat anymore and even though there is a new map,  I dont like the new settings."
"I love to play it. Its good. But it always disconnect me. And when I want to play,  my screen turn black for a long time."
Good game but they ruined the chat with forcing people to use pre set messages this used to be a 5 star review but now 2 stars change it back to free chat with out forcing us to send an email
Well Im here to change my review to a 5 star because every problem I had has been fixed. But theres so many colors now that its hard to spot players
Game is becoming increasingly glitchy and unplayable. Forced to use quick chat only and its really pathetic. Why keep breaking something that was working earlier.
This game is fun but while I was playing it kept disconnecting me and then told me I left intentionally I just wanted to say that but other than that the game is amazing.
"I LOVE THIS GAME because there are 3 imposter and can kill crewmate . crewmate have to do tasks like swipe card, download data and fix wiring so download this game and play everywhere or anytime allahhafiz"
"Not the best app in the first place, Ive seen better, but I WOULD still rate 5 stars cause not many people helped on this game.BUT MAKE A FREIND FEATURE.THIS GAME LITTERALY NEEDS ONEI KEEP LOSING FREINDS BECAUSE YOU INNERSLOTH199999 STARS"
This game was awsome before this new version now I cant even get to play cause its showing that Im DISCONNECTED FROM THE SERVER I dont know what is going on but please fix this

I love this game but the only thing i dont like about it anymore its that we cant type no more we have to press buttons and i wanna type again but its amazing tho
This game is alright but one time I tried to report a body and I couldnt for some reason then a random person reported then they called me the imposter. You guys need to fix the bugs
"Game used to be fine. Now its annoyingly full of bugs and crashes alot. Also,  the quick chat mode is horrible and useless. The game needs to be restored "
I LOVED the original version but the new version I HATE 1 it wont let u choose your own name 2 you can only use easy chat which is not easy to use so if we could choose our own name and not use easy chat that would be AMAZING
I used to really like the game but the new update def ruined it. it is so hard to talk with people and you cant say who the killer is. but It is still kinda fun to play with your friends still.
"I loved the game a lot before the new update, now its just stuck on uploading the maps and doesnt work at all Please fix it"
"Im NYX btw,  Well I love it but the bad part is. U make so many friends and loose them all fast. I got disconnected from this game a lot and lost so many friends iahsuajdhs I search for them but again Nope I hate that about this"
Among us is fun but Among us need 4 imposters and new map and 25 new colours and bannd put colours back in among us now olve fourtogreen and red with yellow and green visor now
Everytime I have been getting into a game it has always been kicking me out and my internet is really good and I really enjoy the game but it gets really annoying
"Among us was fun when I play. But when the game updated,  the game sucks. I cant type anything I want. Pls fix this."
Amazing. I love the fact it is without ads unlike most games. 300 stars is not enough for this game.
Love it but I cant find a way to look at skins and everything. It use to be able to find it in costume but it isnt there anymore. How do you get new skins
The original amongus was so good where you can make your own name and type in what you want to say in meetings but now you have to do something else and its horrible with the new update
I am giving 2 star because when we start a map in my screen it shows a back screen in game it does show Shhhh And the game is very lagging

this game was my all time favourite game and i played a alot this game day night but im very pissed by its new update its so useless and irriatating you can not even chat with any one without signing the id and its so annoying
I love this game famous pictures of how you could get this the way you could talk and chat on among Us fix it there could be another new airship but a solar place and and make it have super big monsters make a solar place please
"Most of the player complain about not typing keyboard on the game. But there is a way to fix that. You can find the solution on YouTube. By the way, Among Us is a great game."

This game was incredible and Ill never forget it however on mobile it has become unusable for me as I cant type in chat anymore and have to rely on the preset options.
Good butthe game has sooo many glitches and bugs I hope you can fix them Btw Ive one suggestion for this game  We can make friends ( its so sad when I have to say goodbye to my among us friends ) 
Great game But ever since the airship update they removed the regular chat which now makes it super hard to prove youre innocent.
"The new update is complete garbage. 1. Theyve added quickchat that brung young users more welcome though,  but why do i have to pay money to register 2.

Theyve added quickchat that brung young users more welcome though,  but why do i have to pay money to register 2.

There are hackers,  which is annoying as hell. 3 stars."
Love the game although there is a slight bug with the cant play a match for 5 minutes because when I disconnect sometimes it says that but overall a great game

Why would u do that when u can crosscheck with my gmail that u are already connected and making me send an email too
I really loved this game but ever since the update i am unable to use my profile before and i cannot chat properly along with me and every other player being pink boxes or invisible. This needs to be fixed
Earlier I really used to like this game where we can write I know they they have removed this because of some hate or bad words put during the game but I didnt like this setting here we cant find the name we want I think old game was only best this new version is not so good at all
This was the best game and now after the update its the worst application existing.... Boo Sorry not sorry Can you please fix the chat Make the chat normal like before
"Super fun and safe for kids,  but doesnt work more often than not Server is constantly overloaded or says it cant find your game "
"Was nice game before update but after update its worse ,  i cant play online without longing i tried to loging my network is full but then also it failed ,  i cant chat with others to say who is imposter or not......"
"I like the game,  but theres a problem. After i signed in once it didnt saved the data and when i try to sign in it bugs and cant play"
"I really love the new update and Im very happy that they finally fixed the servers. One thing I dont like is the chats,  I dont like how they gave a options only."

Im very glad that you can now type instead of using that thingy thats when I came back to among us Love this game so much . This deserves a five star rating.
"I use to love this game but then they changed everything,  like you cant even type what you want to say you have to do it in a different way its much more confusing."
I dont agree with these people saying this game is trash the game is well made I really. Love the fact its updated but can you fix the issue when theres 910 people when I join the lobby its say that my connection is bad but my connection good if you can fix it it will be awsome
Lagging always. Loading for hours. Take hours to refresh new teams. New updates gettimg worse. Initial game was good.
Ever time I try to host a game it is a black screen and then its says disconnected remote was not ackd after 75321ms (9 Resends) even with full bars of internet and full signal this happens.
This used to be a amazing game but after adding the new chat feature everyone deleted it then there was no turning back. This could have become the next minecraft but innersloth ruined it ReviveAmongUs
I wish that u could send the code to your friends on snapchat or sum but when I leave it kicks me its very irritating which it would have like a 2 or 3 minute timer
Overall enjoyable game but it would be like adding the cherry on the cake to add voice chat in discuss lobbies.
Pretty good running experience with GREAT QUALITY I love to be a detective so finding out who an Imposter is a good. Overall I love the game

I really hate the quick chat and also most players leave the match because they want to be imposter which makes the game ends fast less than 5 seconds
Its kinda boring now....Beforw i like it so much.... The chat is so hard to use i cant click fast sometimes i voted out becase of not talking because i dunno how to chat...
What is great but the chat everyone knows about this problem in this game but anyways this game is dying quickly loads of people to play this game and be I know this might be good to you but you know the chat and its dying my gosh
Liked this game a lot in the past. The chatting restrictions just killed all the fun out of this game quite literally. So a 2 for a horrendous decision on gameplay.
This is a good game and its very fun to play with siblings while in the same room. Theres plenty of ways to customize your character. Off your personality by doing so 
"Too many bluffs,  bot,  virus,  security and connectivity issues. Also,  nothing to protect against trollers who spoil almost all games."

Over all its good but it takes forever to update hackers are taking over the game ............ I hate hackers ... They destroy the game they should ban hackers.............. otherwise its fantastic if you agree then click yes
The problems are you cant type or say anything you cant customize your name and it takes long to get from the lobby to the red shhh imposter to the game it is AWFUL
"I love all the new updates The colors,  the vent cleaning task,  the new map,  EVERYTHING,  except quick chat. Remove its so annoying and slow."
"THANK YOU SO MUCH. Im so happy I can type again without being 18. Im not sure how I feel about the new designs,  but hey. At least its better than before."
This game was awesome until the last update... I keep disconnecting from server even I have WiFi router in my house.. otherwise the game is OP.. pls try to fix this problem asap.
This game was once my favorite it became terrible after the update. I really enjoyed this game but now u must sign In and cant even message normal on the chat whats wrong with the makers.
"One of my favourite games,  but only 3 stars because chat is terrible and u cant ask some questions you want to ask,  u need to change it to the original chat else Im not playing"
"You are unable to chat freely. Originally rated it 5 but without being able to chat freely its pointless. EDIT thanks for letting me know,  glad we can use the chat again"
I would give it 5 stars but when I want to play with my friends and put in the code it says Quick chat ONLY That makes me MAD
"Atleast put a floating joystick,  its so annyoinh and hard to use a joystick that is so much in bottom corner of a screen,  and when i select some message,  it requires to send that message immediatly not requesred to press send buttom ,  youre so popular yet so dumb"
This game is nice but please give more colours because all are taking colours and for lastly comming person it has not colours so please keep more colours
"I love this game but I cannot make my own name and I cannot also type whatever I want in chat ,  please make these 2 things normal please please ..I love airship map please add new tasks to all map and add a new map "
Its a really fun game but it will kick me out of the game and it got rid of the other updates within its really stopiod but fun and it will black out me and when I start the game as being the host it atalaticy kill me with is really weird and also it lets me out side of the map when I am alive
"I like the game,  i play it frequently but the problem is whenever i start the first game it starts lagging. Especially in airship map. Fix this Innersloth"
Made it 1 star because the game became worse when u have to have an account to play with friends .. the bug annoys me. And if i try to sign in it always says failed
It is supposed to be the best game but they change the chat options you cant type anything and its getting boring.
"After the updation,  the chat system was become very bad. Please bring back the old chatting system."
Things have been better and worst since the big uptade i was anot able to join friends everytime I go look for a game online it says disconnected from the server when I have full bars of network.. I do and dont recommand this game
I use to love this game but the login the chat everything about this game i hate about now the updates are to extra the game is plain boring now my m isnt gonna put a zip code or number and pay 50 just for this game i really liked this game till now
It is a very fun game.But i dont like that we have to make an account so we can change names and other things. But the game is pretty good
The thing is this is a great game and it was my favourite game but the chat doesnt allow people to speak freely anymore so that ruins the game
"I used to really enjoy playing among us with my family and friends but now I cant enjoy it because I cant hold a conversation with ANYONE. Its really sad,  cause that was honestly the best part of the whole game."
This game is awesome but there is one problem. It wont let me be the imposter it just only let me be a crewmate every single round so please fix this right now. Thank you

Nice game to play with friends . You must try it. Only one prlm is this app takes too much space else it is very nice. You must try it with your friends its graphics our nice
"Ah,  so relaxing to play and hear I had a five star but now it hurts how we cant talk how we want anymore I just hope you fix this so we dont need any parent or guardians help because my parents dont know how to use this"
"This game was great for a while,  then chat was removed and we never know what anyone is saying. (dont fix something thats not broken)"
I allowed my kid to play this game with the free chat and I even sent the gmail...After that the messager blocked the message.. and still she cannot play ...Please fix this bug
I love it so much. You can become imposyor or a crewmate there is so much to explane. This game is awsome. 5 stars DOWNLAOD NOW
I fell like this game whould be better with different roles and a new map and in game voice so you can talk so in chat you dont have to ralea on people reading it but the game overall is good
"Game got bad after a while,  cant free chat and need to sign in for so many things please innersloth fix the chat and the sign in."
The old version was better. I cant type freely let alone play fairly in guest mode. Id rather have the choice to chose my own name too.
It is very cool and amazing I really love this but it changed I cant write my own name in 2020 it was better but it changed and made me very angry but I still love this game.

This game is cool and amazing I love this game because it is so so cool it even has an airship map which is even more cool 
I really like this game I just have a problem it keeps signing me out of the game and when I try to sigh in it wont work
Among us improved the chats are back the accounts are working properly its good I hope the Devs. would add a feature to add friend on crew mates since there now an account system overall the game is great
Wooow best game ever i love it. I know you guys are working on a new update that has sherif and scientist roles and a new map and you literly had a huge update a few months ago the airship you put every hour you have on amung us. Anyway thanks for the awsome game.
"what happened to this game i cant type any text i couldnt defend my self, also its lagging and theres some bugs, idk what happened to the new update it wasnt like this way before.Please fix it"
Used to be a great way to pass the time until developers thought making it quick chat only was a good idea in a game of communication.
"It was fun before the update. Ever since the update came out we have to sign in and we also have to confirm were adults Cant you tell my Gmail account is an adult one cause you have access to it,  right Also on the website to verify youre an adult the credit card one is 50 cents to pay,  just so ...Full ReviewIt was fun before the update. Ever since the update came out we have to sign in and we also have to confirm were adults Cant you tell my Gmail account is an adult one cause you have access to it,  right Also on the website to verify youre an adult the credit card one is 50 cents to pay,  just so youre child or you can play. Isnt that dumb Paying just to play a free game,  you already have to pay just to get a skin. Also why do you need my address or my credit card information Its bad."
Amazing game but I dont like how you cant talk without the thing where you try to talk and it doesnt let you. But overall its an amazing game.
I just want the previous messaging way. I mean we could type whatever we wanted so that was quite good. I would want u to be like before. Please and I believe many others also want the same thing to be done . Sad but this used to be my favourite game 
"I like this game,  but please update so I can add friends and can talk online during the discussion,  when the new update is over,  I rate it five stars"
Very boring always ensures to make crewmares. There is a probability of 95of becoming crewmate. Please do fix it and make it equal of being an imposter or crewmate.
Very nice game and the best thing is that they always give a update and its very fun for everyone who give 1 star is fool because it have to be5 stars i love this game and keep it going
I loved it until you put the chat update in you can do better cmon.This is why the popularity has changed so I think you should change the chat back and so u dont have to log on to change your name to what u want.This game needs major updating
The game is fun but it was much more fun when you could have free chat can you please try to bring back free chat please
Its a good game but when u verify that your a adult you dont get your money back like we need our money back because its supposed to be a free game and if u needed to verify us u do so but give our money back because you never know if we need it or not
It is a good game. I gave it four start because the new chat update is driving me mad. You can only say limited things. Among us can u please change it back. 
When Among Us was popular it was more fun what the new update where you cannot use the name and the chat without paying maybe only give it to Stars whenever it didnt have this I would have gave it five stars but its ruined
Super fun I love this game I understand why they updated the chat I played it before and everyone was cussing but I wish I could change my username otherwise great game
"This game is one of the best video game I have ever played but please remove the safe chat,  Thanks and keep up the good work"
"It is a good game,  but it was better when the chat could be used freely instead of the preset answerschat options."
Edit I cant even play anymore. I try to but it either does not let me or it takes a crazy amount of time. I have redownloaded multiple times yet nothing works.
"Its a good game but you need an account now which I think is a discomfort,  it was easier before when you could just download and start playing"
I like it a just kidding one star only because theres auto chat we cant make friend message and second is auto name like dooon howlghoul etc so only one star
"I dont like the new update in Among us because you cant type your word you want to type. And you have to put your cedit or debit card number in. And they do that to make sure your an adult, and I dont trust Among us no more."
I dont know whats wrong with the game anymore but it doesnt load into the game it just stays blank for so long and then loads out
Now among us is more better then last time we can create our accounts with no Gmails but one little problem we sign in we get our account and are going to play online but says you dont have an account until you switch your country to Asia that works for me but among us is improved.

Now theres no problems we can play without switching our country and I love the new charecters my sis and me play together thanks inersloth .
Bring back normal keyboard texting . The is way better than this buttons thing where its a headache. Bring back normal chatting method and I will give a good review and good rating
Its a good game why people hating on it though anywho I just wish they added updates more frequently and its stupid kay it made me wait 4 mins to get back in a game for intentionality disconnecting BUT I GOT KICKED OUT FOR NO DANG REASON Change it pls
"This game I loved it until Airship It got so dum after that,  no longer free chat Cant name yourself Cmon really This used to be fun what happen"

The quick chat feature just spoiled all the fun.... You should let us type along with the quickchat then itll be fine and all good. Bring the old chatting feature back and Ill rate this game 5 stars
It wont let me type in chat half the time for no reason and is always glitching me out of the game. Im always at night ping.
Not five stars as It is forcing me to ma ke an acount which i cant make so not gave five stars and the chat is very bad the normal one was good and it glitches that you are dissconected through the server pls fix this othervise it is a very good game
This game is fun but... The new chat is way worse just get rid of it pls but I like the cleaning the vent task its so cool So it is fun but not that fun but its funner then not fun
I liked the original version.It annoys me that you cant say what you want In chat.But I do like the new map.What is annoying aswell is you have to put your email to choose your own.Please get the chat back
I love among us but many glitches happen  for exampleA alone mini crewmate in the dropship with color fortegreen which changes to the pet dog soo that is a complain plus a good thing of among us
I like this game very much. This is the best game ever I love it . But pls give a free pet pls oh pls oh pls... We love the pets .At least like if you win 100 rounds as Impostor or 200 times as crew mate pls... 
"It Doesnt Download the Maps,  access ect .I kept it to download. I waited 30mins To download it,  and guess what the download bar was not even strarted to fill."
This game is so cool. Not needed to spend real money. The only concern is about pings.
Hello guys so I love this game but it used to be all black for me and I never used to be able to see my charactor and now its updated I can now be able to see everything 
I like the game..... But the things I dont like first is the chat.... We cannot type the words.... It is very bad The second thing is the name We cannot type our own name So.. I humbly request innersloth to fix this
This game is amazing but Its stuck on the loading dots to join a game also when I create a game my screen turns black and stays like that Please fix
The game is very much fun... Thank you for noticing my previous review. Im able to chat freely during the game. So far so good
"With the new chat the game is nonsense. The only point of the game was explaining what did you see,  which is impossible now."
"Yeah,  umm so this game is great in all but I dont like were the game give you words to say not words YOU want to say but also you cant name yourself what YOU want to name yourself but there are really great names But besides all of that this game would be great"
Very fun and cool I just dont like that the game takes a long time to start and I like the new colors.
I dont like it as much because when I sign in it still wont let me free chat.but the game it self is good but fix chat please go back to free chat and Im 48 I shouldnt need to sign in with garden I have trouble spelling though

This game is so fun I love it that is why I rate 4 stars I also encouraged my cousins to play too. I love inner sloth games but there is one problem it does not load accurately.
This game is fun but when there is a emergency meeting or dead body report in the chat we need to find the names and so on it would be really nice if u let us type there plz fix it it takes for ever to find the words and send it plz FIX IT PLZ
"Its fun and all,  new tasks,  colors great but the chat. Its horrible when someone says a bad word just put stars. But now is sooooo hard to accuse someone. pls pls pls plz plz change the chat back."
Very nice and interesing game must install but I hate the new update in this update we cant text properly we cant keep our names the previous versions were better.....
"Its a good game,  the only thing is the skins and pets cost money ( the colors and hats are free.. Why not skins and pets Also theres to many pervs trying to make this whole game a dating app..Why did you even add the option to censor or not censor bad words Thats dumb.."
They update the game too much like 1week ago i updated the game and than today I wanted to play with my friend and we had to update it and took us a long time so we couldnt play so plz stop updating the game that much and update it 1 time every moth plz
"It is a good game until it updated....still I love to play it with my friends,  cousins and my siblings that is exactly why I have give it 5 stars"
Its fun you can chance your hat and color you can also create your own game or you can join some other persons game. I love it when there are more things added like new hats and new colours.
I really love this game. But we cant type in match or we can change names.only quick chat.......thats why i hate this name and.......stop playing it....plz bring a apdate....that we can type in match...remove quick chat...plz itz my requst.....it ia not working plz bring an apdate remove quick chat....Full ReviewI really love this game.

"It is pretty good game but,  I hate it Because of quick chat. Its hard to play Ex when I saw a imposter kills and I reported the body then I cant tell who is the imposter because of quick chat Please fix it."
I used to play this game until the chat is ruined Now I cant understand why are they saying and yes do Not installed this stupid game stupid features now I cant access to the name button unless you need a account this is the stupid game ever
I have to reinstall the games many times. The joystick sometimes didnt work. And also i cant complete the task due to bug on the joystick.
I just get disconnected disconnected disconnected for nothing but my network is working good why Then it said to host then I hosted a game then people joined my game but then I GOT disconnected from my own game who can play this game
This is a really good game now that the regular chat is back. I play this game for hours with my sister. Its a really fun game
This game teaches you how stupid human beings can be and that even donkeys are smarter than majority of the player base. The game is awesome with friends but terrible against random people. Its not the games fault but humans lack of intelligence.
"Okay, the new update solved all my problems in this game.There are a few glitches in it but I dont care cause every game has glitches.Tho great game and i like it a lot."
The best game I have played in my life the graphics are best the colours are best the design are of among us is best of best the game is smooth and you can play in very short amount of network All the maps are perfect and beautiful 
"A good game with satisfying features like this Im waiting for the next update from Among us,  this is exciting,  btw,  I like the new map"
"This is not the among us i used to play , i camt make a private room for me and my friends ,  i cant play without making an account and cant find any public games ,  what th hell is this ,  you really ruined the game change it back or you will get more 1s"
On this game is very fun but the only problem is how do I play this game how do you earn money how you fix the problem so thats what I gave this a for rating star
the new update is bad why do you need to sign in just to play i find it very dumb that you either have to confirm your email or not just to put a name and i hate how you have to keep the name that you dont want its so stupid. i perfer the old among us cause this new update stinks.
"So fun. When you die,  you can still do tasks or sabatoge. If you are reading this review,  just install this game. It is the best"
"That game is fun and entertaining,  the game used to be easy until quick chat was made and it became harder to say anything in chat."
"I had lot of fun playing this game .but why the thing i gave 4 stars because if i play it in the mobile i cant chat or write what i want to but other than that this is best game ever i have played before thanks for making the game , thanks bye"
I dont hate the game but i can not win nore lose every time i start a match the game disconects me for like the dumbest reasons i would just like for you to fix that and it would be a 5 star for me. But for now its a 3 FIX YOUR GAME
Thank you so much for fixing everything. Now there is the actual chat again and players no longer show up as pink blobs
I can play with friends without any glitch and ads when I have not recharge my phone then also I play it by switch on internet
I like this game. It is really a awesome game. But I cant give it a 5 star because it required permission of parents and this thing is very annoying. But overall this game is too much fun.
Very good game but I take 1 star off since they added the worst thing ever quick chat. It is so annoying it took me for ever to log in with google play
Fun game but it would be better if it was downloadable on all devices so more people could enjoy it. Thank you.
"There is an annoying bug for mobile,  the email dosent get sent which means i am unable to log into my account and have some fun playing on this game,  please fix this innersloth."
"Edit. Well this is a very fun game at the same time, it has high quality and also is a good game but I couldnt change my name to how I want so I suggest the developers change that.But its just a suggestion."
"This game used to be good. The inability to actually chat on a game which is essentially a social bluffing game,  completely ruins it."
"Most of the time when I join a game,  it kicks me out. Pretty fun to play when I do get to play but can this issue to be fixed soon"
I dont even get the option to type in what I wanna say even if i try to change it in setting.Pls fix it is super annoying and makes me want to uninstall it.But over all a pretty fun game aside from that feature
"A good game but there was a little issue,  even though I had enough space in memory it still didnt download,  I had to disable my voicemail to get it"
Sooo....about the update. Its pretty hard to use for some players.

Here are some words I suggest I probably didnt mention Date Go out etc.
This game used to be fun before but after the new update where we cannot speak freely it is not the same anymore the game feels boring now since we cannot speak anymore freely and because of this reason the game is dying.
"this WAS the best game ever. Until the autochat appdate this was the best game ever. INNERSLOTH WHAT ARE YOU DOIN IN THE PAST THERE WAS 600 MIL DONLOADS NOW LIKE 50 MIL no but seriusly innerslot,  in the help of god and all of the things that left in the world REMOVE THE AUTO CHAT"
You have to sign into say your own words and its really annoying I wish Among Us didnt have to spend money on outfits to and I could go on and on by like two more things and I forget Zen pose
It was a good game until they added some changes like the chat its the worst and for me they never let me join a public server or create my server they olny let me join a private server..... I want the old version back
I think among us is a great way to play with friends and have fun. You can kill people and vent away and others try and fin out who did it while you kill more. You can frame people too anyway I give it 5 stars

The newer version sucks. You cant even talk and defend yourself. It takes too long to go look up the messages you want to say. Its freaking retarded.
The manage data collection button links to a broken webpage. You have no choice but to accept their data collection (illegal).
I cant even play it crashes each time I use it or about to play the game and each time I get imposter the game crashes quickly and its the same as the crewmate please make the game more playable
This game is really nice and very good but when i was playing the imposter was really lagging so i just stayed but then i got killed he was running away he tried to kill meanbike but meanbike didnt die I DIED
"The game is fabulous as we all know,  but i would love options on graffics quality and the arrows option (option that allows us to move with arrows on the screen) pls take my request to consideration. Thank you...."
You cant chat Dialogue is half the game Accusations and figuring out who did what is a huge part of this game and its been taken out
"All ok..but hackers are so annoying..almost 65 time i found hacker on game..if the problem can be solved, i will give 5 star"
"The new update isnt that great,  because you cant write your own sentences and you have to search long. On the other side I understand."
"Best game ever Long time ago,  everytime I rejoin,  ads appear and so annoying. But now,  thanks for clearing the ads"
The game is very good Great animation and game space and 15 player lobby in so much more fun to play But really miss the old dead body and blood splatter animation (
"Its a good game,  thats it but it still needs more features though,  but other than its worth a try. Edit didnt expect this game to blew up lol."
"Well, thx Inerslot for changing it..Now it was easy to chat...After all the changes I recommend it.The art is great and it is not laggy."
THIS IS SUCH A BAD GAME Im not trynna be a Karen and all but my children cant even play it. They just spam the find game button it worst even let you put in a code it loads and loads the whole time This game is a waste of space
They changed the chat amd it may be safer for kids but you cant even say hi or whatever you want. Plus when it wasnt like that it bleeped out the cussing but now you cant say what you want.
I dont really like the new update because the chat wont let you write whatever it give you options and I was confused and I didnt tell you about the update
"Its nice,  but with the new update,  it takes a long time for shhh to come. I HATE QUICKCHAT Now I cant even say I have scan. SO REVOVE THESE ASAP if u do I will happily give this 5 stars ( btw does murr3y exist )"
So i have no complaint about this game the only problem i have that u should add new update in among us. If u will add extra roles into this game then that would be epic and everybody will start liking this game or any new update should come imao
"I like it before 2020 but after update i can, t type freely thats why 4 star only so please fix this problem i want super chat and freely chat both in this game otherwise this game is superb"
"This game is terrible. Truly terrible. Thats its strength. Because it is awful,  some hilarious moments occur in this game. 010 game,  1010 party experience."
The europe servers keep going down and I cant connect to them anymore even though I have a strong Internet connection
"The game is great,  but when I run it,  it loads and then a black screen appears and then I go back to the main phone screen. I hope there is a solution"
Good game but the new chatting mechanic is for difficult to get on to other than that its a great game
This was my favourite game once but now it is not. I know the Devs of the game were preventing cyber bullying but now we cant communicate to others clearly and so there is not fun. So Plz
They need to fix the hacking thing. I was playing among us one time and the game banned me for hacking. When I wasnt hacking I dont even know how to do it. All I was doing was telling people that I have scan and who is safe then I get banned for Hacking NOTHING.

We need to be able to talk in chat I have to use the circle thing and it doesnt get my point across to the other crewmates. And we are all just voting willy nilly and cause of it I always lose u have to fix that
Very fun game. It passes a lot of time .I like to be an Imposter .My brother and sister love it 
It may be a good game to play but for some reason I cant type. So if I see an imposter kill someone I cant speak. And this has happened like a few months ago and I thought it would be changed but no so pls improve that
This game is really fun I wanted this game and now I have the game and I love it But since the update to delete free chat its been more boring and harder  IM MAD FIX THIS ( ( 
Good game  Amazing but it should have a friends list that you can add friends that would make this game better than it is
"Very fun game New update wont let me type in codes tho,  and I dont know what to do but other than that very good"
Fix the Quick chat we cannot change 1 step click at back at down left. 2 step go in settings. 3 step click on data at up. 4 step if u can change chat type then change it.
"I was horrified at the chat system in this game my 6year old plays this game and the chat was sickening to see,  really needs a chat mod or something similar theres people trying to groom children on this app its disgusting"
This games updates doesnt make it better...infact it is much boring than before and now you cannot even type what you want you only have limited options to chat...I will recommend you to not install this app cause it is a waste of time.
Its a nice game and everyone should get a chance to become imp 1 player became 7 times impostor continuesly and everyone should get all skins please take care of this else the game is fine.
"This game is awesome.but the reason why i gave 4 stars are because all the pets and skins needs to pay, but i am dreaming of having cool skins and pets for free.pls make some free stuff."

It is good but gets boring sometimes and the shhh screen freezes on blank for about 10 seconds ever since the new map. PLEASE WORK WITH 5UP AND GET SUBMERGED AS A NEW MAP IT IS SOO GOOD IT WOULD BE GREAT TO ADD IT TO YOUR GAME )
the game is really updated but not completely theres an issue on the guardian needed on the account and the chat please remove the quick chat its messing up the game still deserves 4 stars
This is a very good game And I dont think so that this game need any time of improvement and I will give 5 stars Because this is the best game I have ever played I never get bored with it this is a very good game

The Airship. The safe task in Cargo is playing up. Turn to the number that the arrow points but it keeps not picking up numbers. Its really frustrating.
I love it the stuff you have to do as a crewmate along it being called tasks go great with the murder mystery plus its really entertaining to hear the word imposter bc of this game and its a good word for the killer

I used to enjoy playing this game but i dont because you changed the controls and the speech is hard to do because I dont know how to say blue vented.
Its a really fun game the problem is theres a bunch of hackers in the game once someone downloaded a hack that closed all the doors and made it so they would never open then the hacker would sabotage the reactor
i used to love this game now i hate it because now i cant type without paying and its really bad now i want the old among us back please make this game go back to the way it was
Fun game. I wish there was an add friend button. But overall great game.
A bit boring and glitches come up regularly not much to do but I like this app please fix the problems for other people and read there comments thats why there there.

I love this app its so so fun and cool. but the 1 thing about that is the chat update I dint like the quick chat update can you remove it
"ITS SO GOOD GAME SIGN IN EASYbut if you play as guest it dosent let you do these stuffchange name.freechat.and if THATS ITand if you dont have an account and sign in,  it will make an account for you also its free on mobile"
Among us is really being a boring game to play.We have to only complete the tasks which are very much being boring.The tasks are always being repeated.Thats why I gave this game only one star.
It was a very very fun game playing with your friends finding out who the imposter is until auto chat came it ruined the game no hate to the creator but just remove auto chat it will make this game much funer thats why I rate it 3 stars also PLZ REMOVE THE hackers
The best game ever  but a problem the problem is that some unlucky people in a alone lobby a hacker message comes it says that hack or get hacked package very sad but this is one of the famous game in 2021  thats for sure
I love this app but this updation makes me uninstall this app because we cant even type what we want we have to select sentences and it requires a lot of time ....
Its good game but in newest updates its became too boring please put back changes and please we cant comment what we want and its too hard can you please fix it and we cant type our names so pelase that also change these want to change please colous and others are perfect but these 2 things are ir...Full ReviewIts good game but in newest updates its became too boring please put back changes and please we cant comment what we want and its too hard can you please fix it and we cant type our names so pelase that also change these want to change please colous and others are perfect but these 2 things are irritating me 
Its a good game but Im giving 2stars cause you cant actually talk to the other people and the chat options suck. PLEASE CAN IT GO BACK TO BEING LIKE THE OLD VERSION
I use to LOVE this game but now we cant chat properly because its really hard so I would recommend but because of the chat instead of 5 stars its sadly 3
Hey team.......i really really love this game no doubt...but there is something i want the team to understand there are so many in game who use bad language n worse names which makes us quite uncomfortable to even enter tht game room n play with those ppl can u help it in anyway its really really b...Full ReviewHey team.......i really really love this game no doubt...but there is something i want the team to understand there are so many in game who use bad language n worse names which makes us quite uncomfortable to even enter tht game room n play with those ppl can u help it in anyway its really really bad at this point n its really sad how we cant enjoy a simple game without going through these things. Game is great but some are ruining it. Help it.
"Good game but i like it 1BUT I CANT CHAT please make a update and made it become we can chat freely I already Typed my email but it doesnt WORK,  also i saw your review and it didnt work . Also did you remove the hackers Sire Sirol and Eris Loris and Garebear and Eric lork Cause pls remove them"
I used to love this game it was a fun game to play with your friends but the quick chat is no fun please change it I really hate it
The new chatting system is poor if your not 18 you dont get the free chat its takes the hole meeting to say anything its poor I hate it thats why some of us are deleting the game ugh its poor system ugh..
"I was waiting for 45 ,  and I see this not letting me in and why cant it work what happened to the game I was waiting but wjats this oh idk this is so boring to wait here want play it why does it not work whats wrong with the game idk it quits letting me log out so please. Fix bug."
This new update has so much glitches fix those and i miss the glitch that if u tap the use button again and again ubwill become 90 imposter.
"THE BEST GAME EVERRRR among us is so so so SO fun You can becone imposter and you can kill people and you have to guess who did it. You have to do tasks ans save the ship . you can change your name, color,  and hat This game keeps me going all day long and i love itttt"
Game used to be so fun but my only complain is they took free chat we need this back it used to be so fun when people would roast each other and was way quicker to type now its so hard give free chat back
I love the game there are a lot of tasks. But the reason I give it 4 stars is that I played a lot of rounds but never got imposter fix it
Complete garbage the update made unecessary changes like limiting your name customisation to random along with RUINING THE CHAT the new colors were great but it made the game blurry this was gold to garbage only redowloaded it for the memes.
"Fun,  but for some reason I cant do discord voice chat and play the game. It turns black,  then turns on. Its so weird,  I dont know why"
Oum.. This is new update. But the les is very nice but now the chat only quick chat its not nice now in the chat but its okay its just a little problem. Just love among us updates.
I loved this game so much that I gave it 5 stars but until the update its unplayable with the new chat system I still like the game but please fix the chat
This game best before but after update it really sucks before we could freely chat n say what ever we want.but now we need find thins we want to say and still we are finding the meeting ends.they should fix this
Nice game its so fun to play this game but there is 3 issues with this game 1.this game has so many bugs please fix them soon as possible 2.this game has only 1 intresting rool imposter crewmate is not that inteesing than imposter 3.this game has no friend list and no extra rools OTHERWISE THIS GAM...Full ReviewNice game its so fun to play this game but there is 3 issues with this game 1.this game has so many bugs please fix them soon as possible 2.this game has only 1 intresting rool imposter crewmate is not that inteesing than imposter 3.this game has no friend list and no extra rools OTHERWISE THIS GAME IS AMAZING )
"this is a very good game too the company of youtube,  SO many people play it becuase it having these mods and stuff,  i think you should support the people making mods and mods)"
Everytime I try to join a game it says ( You disconnected from the server. Reliable packet 1 (size26) was not ackd after 7509ms (9 resends) )
"Could have given a 5star rating ,  but nowadays whenever I start the game it says unknown error occurred and cancels the game . Wth"
"Wow  The update is better and I gave 3 star , but not 5 star because it is still not free chat as I told before please make the chat free."
Theres no way to access your account or edit you chat settings. I cant even play unless I give my social security number or credit card. This dinky little game doesnt need that kind of information.
Love the game still. But the my hero academia lobbies being the only options and them banning anyone that joins is annoying. And Im a fan of the show too.
I like this game its a very entertaining game I should say but the update is very annoying and u cant really time in the chat its alright but the update it isnt really for me so Im not saying this game is bad no its a very popular entertainment game I should say  but please some people dont...Full ReviewI like this game its a very entertaining game I should say but the update is very annoying and u cant really time in the chat its alright but the update it isnt really for me so Im not saying this game is bad no its a very popular entertainment game I should say  but please some people dont like the update me go and its really annoying very nice game tho 
I like the game so much that I lost my load before but now in the new update....why do you guys have too make quick chat Like I know its for the naughty language but if that happens then just blurr it....nobody would play this game if the game is this boring now
it just puts weird names like Wisehorse and Gemburger boo..I hate this game there are a few disconnects when i try to find a game in public and when its full where all the people are there in the game...And pls fix one of the bugs i told you
I gave this 4 stars cause when the game starts my screen is black and shhhh is good but when I move to starts to lag and can among us have quests for items like pets.
Just after the update this game stinks.I have logged in but I cant use free chat and it says to download additional things but it cant download even when internet is good or connected to hotspot.Please fix this problem quickly.
Ok the chatting system is super confusing to be honest I mean I like how you remastered it its just the chatting system you did bad with like we cant speak in our own words I have to pick one and you cant even find it and its just confusing theirs my feedback about the chatting system.
"This game is good but its better if it has voice chat and if we can type,  we can not type we can only choose what you want to say."
I legit cannot even play one game without it freezing or glitching I have not finished even one game since I installed it....The og version was much better than this stupid update.
"Bugs were fixed,  but all the lobbies are sketchy and weird. Also hacking has become rampant for those trying to enjoy the game."
The game is okay now but theres so much wired changes and I wished they keeped it in its old state. It was much better back then
Cool game needs work on more coulers free skins more cool tasks 2more maps more servers like an under water map free pets more players atleast 20 and 5 imposters and ad discord in the app plz . And they sould ad new louding like an imposter kills an crewmate and like my commentso thay can see
Me and my brother are so happy the airship map is here woohoo but the problem it took forever to start fix this I cant play cause it took long to start If you fix this Ill rate it 5 stars
I am tryimg to update and it tells me this()and my second problem when u want to chat u r forced to not use ur own words so 1 star if there was negetive 5 stars i would do that i hate this
Wow so great game LOL. You made it to Where my brother cant play because we dont have 2 phones and he plays on the nintendo switch. So can you fix that please. And make it to where we are on phone can change our chat.
Good game but there are many hackers and also there shouldnt be an option to leave the game for not getting an imposter.
"Trash. You cant customize your name anymore,  the chat is awful,  and it doesnt even work for me more than half the time Its sad such a good game got ruined like this."
This game was pretty fun however at the beginning of the game almost everyone just leaves because they are not the imposter and that ruins the game please do something about this
"I LOVE IT The graphics are awesome,  its online,  and best of all... NO ADS Thank GOD for that Thank u Innersloth for making this game "
Wen ever I start the game or someone starts the game I have a black screen I can interact with the buttons but I cant see anything please fix it.
I cant play  this game because its not loading atoll when I press this find the game button its loading for a long time please change this update and make the last game the last game was super
It is a very well made game  it a very fun and mystery game and u can play with friend the is of course a problem on the airship map whenever u pick a location u sometime become frozen and it a bit annoying but if u fix this it a very awesome game
"Would be better that when a crew mate is killed,  they should be able to see who are the imposters. Also it would be better when quick typing that each name is the colour that player is in the game"
It was a great game until they updated it. it is just dumb like I mean when you want to say who the imposter is you have to click a bunch of things just to put down one name.
Its really fun to play this game but ever since the update happened we are not able to keep our own names and nothing in chat except the words you have given if the update was good I would have rated it 5
I can play this game forever and when I found out that crewmates are able to do something with one of the vents I went straight to Google play and updated Among us.I didnt even care about the other ones
The game is good but after the update it got wrecked. Also take out this stupid thing where it locks you out of instantly leaving games. It is very annoying
i dont think this game is now best because this game old version is best but when this think is updated i feel like i am playing a fake among us we cant write in discussion time we and the chat graphics is not good please fix it
I played this for a while but then they changed everything you cant even type what you want in the chat. So I deleted it i would give it a 0 star but you cant do that
This game is amazing but 1 problem i hate quick chat cause when i found imposter i called meeting and in chat i got hard finding stuff to Talk i waste my time finding and i got voted out ( but still game is fun
Id say it is a good game but its doom its crashes my phone everytime i open this app (jk jk) THISS GAMMEEE ISSS SOO GOODDD IM IN LOVE WITH THIS GAME ITS GIVES YOU AN ONLINE CHAT WE CAN TALK WITH THE PEOPLE IN OR OUTSIDE OUR COUNTRY AND CITY
Its a very good game and ssundee should do more mods because they are really fun to watch on YouTube and go and go sub to him hes trying to get to 20Mil by the end of the year and he will hit his target with your help.
"It is nice but every time the match starts I get TAKEN TO MY TABS HOME SCREEN,  It even happens in FREEPLAY..... My Tablet version is 7.1.2 The game is cool tho Please Fix This..."
"The Game has many bugs that I cant seem to fix manuely,  I havent played the game in a week. I came back to see if the problems were fixed and they werent"
I really like this game but please add add friends because everyday i meet new friends and when they have to leave i never get to see them again so please im begging you to add add friends thats the only thing im asking for thank you.
I hate this game because if we want to chat quick we cannot they will think that I am the imposter or someone else I will be knowing but I cannot say quick that pervious game that was fine we can message easily it was there now u guys update this game so it became worst so remove that message and ad...Full ReviewI hate this game because if we want to chat quick we cannot they will think that I am the imposter or someone else I will be knowing but I cannot say quick that pervious game that was fine we can message easily it was there now u guys update this game so it became worst so remove that message and add that previous one to message fast so I hate this game
"I would really love it if you could text your own name in and if you could text in the game by yourself and if it does not get fixed i will delete this game and never ever even see,  or even text or even say in my life"
You cant type anything I know why among us got rid of typing anything because of people dating I get it but just make it tags or something and bring the old typing back I rate it a 1 star because you cant type anything anymore
This is a good game but on android for me the vision goes all funny and there is shadows everywhere. I also really hate the chat.
"Before the new UpDaTe i loved the game and spent about 12 dollars on the game for accessories,  but now the chat is very annoying,  even though new skins are cool, "
It is nice game but after the update we cannot write the message with our own this cause we cannot explain nicely ourself and cannot accuse the player which was we sus or we saw him vented or killed other there is only given a option to select a messege
It is a good game but bec ia giveing 4 star it is bec the chat is bad we cant talk togather but i have a trick to open the chat and you have to fix the chat if you have to chat you have to sing in
I cannot find a game even if I am on the latest version and my internet is strong. Always says reliable packet
I once like this game but there is something bothering me. I now that I need to login to available the update but it always says error. I just wish that I can play with the new update without logging in. Then I will give you 5 
Well um its like I kinda like it it just needs to fix these Like idk wut its called it might Be called Buxs or Buxes but You do need to fix it becuz on My other Device it just stays on the Shhhh screen untill the imposter does something Like kill someone Or something else  Kinda like that  b...Full ReviewWell um its like I kinda like it it just needs to fix these Like idk wut its called it might Be called Buxs or Buxes but You do need to fix it becuz on My other Device it just stays on the Shhhh screen untill the imposter does something Like kill someone Or something else  Kinda like that  but pls fix all of this Now pls (^^) Thanks
"Used to be my favourite Updated to much just like fortnite,  e.g  Have to randomize name need account to choose some setting and stuff like that. All i really wanna say is you could have done better.."
It was really fun a nice but when the update came it was terrible pls remove the update for the chat and maybe say No Bad Words When they say a bad word And so yeah. Bai
I dont like it. I used to like it before without the chat and the new map. Now it doesnt let my play online and it takes for ever and at the end it doesnt let me in to choose a game to play.
I love this game but the new update is so Boring. Its really fun I its a happy game but I liked the old versin but now its just not that fun but I still like it and much better with playing with friends
"I cant play a game without it crashing,  nothing loads,  not even Freeplay mode,  so this is why I gave it one star"
"Quick text has destroyed it. The fun was always in trying to persuade others into believing your story,  all that has gone now."
"I love amoung us and its fun mysteries and sometimes when Im playing with my lil sis and always win together. The only thing is sometimes among us bans me and say Please Stop Hacking.

Anyways,  overall I love this game and I definetly recommend it to people who love mysteries and anyone in general."
"I used to he inseparable from among us,  but when the new update happend i stopped,  only because of the chat someone its hard to use and confusing i want the old chat back ("
Of course everyone is rating this game 1 star after the new update i used to play this game so much and it was one of my favourites until this new update especially the chat function the free chat function was making the game better and making us know who the imposter is
My game keeps saying a disconnected error everytime I try to connect to play the game please help or is there someone I could talk to to get this problem fixed thank you
"So other than this the game is great,  but i cannot sign in. I do not know if I am doing something wrong but I want to sign in. Please make it easier. Thank you. Until then 3 stars."
It is a really fun game but I wish yall would add something with a thing where the crewmates can defend themselves with instead of just voting a imposter out but really love the game.
"Used to love this game,  but now its ruined due to the chat changing to autofill. Please fix this."
only like the new colours the hats and the fact I can play with more people I hate the fact that I cant say what I want and its not nice how it waists up all ur space and you have to make an account .

I love among us so much and i love this map so much now i cant stop playing among us but i hate one thing the fast chat feature we cant talk so please our normal chat feature is good bring it back please i also cant sign in
"When I get into a lobby I cannot type in the chat,  no matter what I do it doesnt fix the problem,  its really annoying and easily accused of."
"Tje game is very awesome,  but there is this problem where you are playing it takes you to the home screen saying 6 PINGS WERE SENT please fix this problem"
How to get almost a invisible name in among us 1st go to profile click name change language to Symbols close this dot  and press it and press Ok and play a game or host a game to see if it works
It was amazing at the start but now with the new update its still very fun so everyone elses description of the game its true and not true so I rate 5 
its actually a good murder mystery game but with no update for a while its getting repetitive.
Well I mean there is nothing wrong But I want to be able to pick my own name and write my own words in emergency meetings other wise I love this app
There are only 2 things that ruin the game and these are 1. HackersExploiters 2. The chat update Anything else doesnt ruin the game at all but if Innersloth can do anything about these problems i will put the last star
Its nice and now as we have a option to report users who abuse or do something inappropriate we can report them.... nice game and you all should definitely try this) Like this game
The old days were good but now I cant even type the weal thing is hard to use but the new map and tasks are cool the only thing that they need to change back is typing
It used to be great then you new speech cMe in and made the game annoying and dumb youd use to be able to type instantly but nw for like a sentence it takes like hf an hour
The game keeps crashing. Its a fun game but it keeps kicking me and with good internet falid 6 pings. It wont let me even sine in to change quick chat and i cant play with friends.
Amazing app there are new tasks and colour they r amazing just wow but please open the chats I know the reason but we r sorry we will not do that things again I didnt give 5th star because of chat please fix it
1 star is less because no chating to find the words it takes so much time. If you could add the old chatting stuff 5 star 
its great and all but games usually stop especcialy when it says you send six pings or something like that but except that its a really amazing game
This is a fun game but when the. Part where quicj chat was added and you could not type anoying but then they added the setting quickchat and freechat so so much easier to explain yourself
In octuber 2020 this game is one of the best game but when update will come this game was become most complicated and so hard sign in is the worst part of the game....innersloth pls read my review and pls give us old among us back...my friends uninstalled this game and i also do if u give not old am...Full ReviewIn octuber 2020 this game is one of the best game but when update will come this game was become most complicated and so hard sign in is the worst part of the game....innersloth pls read my review and pls give us old among us back...my friends uninstalled this game and i also do if u give not old among us so pls read my review and reply and give old among us back....thnx
The game used to be fun until the update now I cant change my name and I can only say certain words I really hate the update pls fix it. And now the game is getting boring idk why you would do this its not good and it isnt fun 
Why do I have to sign in it wasnt like that before Im sorry but the old version was much better than this one but I enjoyed it giving me things to say
Ok so there is a bug where it just shows a black screen when you create a game AND PLEASE REMOVE THE THING where it kicks everybody it Its very anoyying
Great game having a lot of fun playing but keep getting kicked out mid games is this a bug that needs to be fixed Cuz its getting real annoying
"Im not logging in to use free chat,  just bring it back or Ill give 0 stars. Hm "
Awsome game and its good that the developer brings back the old text chat because the previous update were the text chat has been removed was an awful update and im glad the developer brings it back 
"They have completely ruined the game,  before this was the best now it sucks,  the chat system,  the fact you cannot choose youname if you dont have an account is very bad"
Very sentcertif but the game has to slow down due to its too quick. And remove the pings you Bch
The freedom to come up with elaborate lies through the chat was the best part of the game. Menubased chat ruined it.
I have a complaint so one day while I was playing. I was in an emergency meeting.

I love this game so muchhhh but one problem I dont like the graphics of crewmates and imposter but I like it so much. This is a gg.
I loved this game a lot before update. The chat sensor was terible plzz dont update this game .if you can do it ill gave 5 star.
Hay mr innersloth I have a idea if you dont wanna remove the quick chat why not make quick chat  free chat a thing if talk to somebody related word not in quick chat then you can use free chat and a little lazy in mobile you can press to on the quick chat and free chat... normal press the text on ...Full ReviewHay mr innersloth I have a idea if you dont wanna remove the quick chat why not make quick chat  free chat a thing if talk to somebody related word not in quick chat then you can use free chat and a little lazy in mobile you can press to on the quick chat and free chat... normal press the text on computer be the same by the way when can you add the submerge map
All the new updates have caused the game to lack interest. Ever since this game gained popularity it has gotten repeatedly worse. What was once an original masterpiece is now a boring game.
I used to love this and play it all the time but the new chat system is very bad now i cant speak for myself it is very hard to chat ok the names system is good but pls fix chat begging you.
I love the game but theres one issue that I do not understand Why is the chat thing off because everytime when I try to play the game it will never let me type
Ok this game is awesome and asow about the quick chat you just gotta create an account and boom you can write whatever you want so its super easy and awesome
"I like this game alot,  but please take the quick chat I am getting some problems, I cant tell what I think and also put friends in the submerged map update please"
Okay heres things about Among Us that are really annoying one you cant chat anymore like typing and to you have too many players in your lobby and 3 the Airship doesnt even make sense so please change it back
"It was a good game before quick chat was added. It just makes the game worse in my opinion,  people can barley understand others."
"The developers are LAZY  The airship map is same as at nintendo. Well they fixed some bugs,  but why it took 3 months  Like they announced on twitter that they are creating gamemodes and map 5. Do they are going to take 6 months because of new gamemodes "
starting to play this game alot more and i am enjoying it but we need a friending system cuz we have all ran in to people in game and became friends but when we have to leave we never see them again 4 stars again
"When you play with a large group of friends you can talk to in person this the funnest game,  but when you play with strangers its a speed typing game where your logic isnt good enough."
"I love this game,  I would give it a 5 star but it has some bugs it needs to fix. But this game is still really good."
"After installing the app ,  it wont work it loaded for a pretty long time and then it bring me to play store or sometimes it get out of the app ."
"Gonna rate this 4 star for now since I was able to get my free chats back by signing up,  sadly I couldnt have a proper game at all since the game is filled with hackers. Is there any way to minimize them."
I like the game alot but the new feature where you need a SSN to join other lobbies is in cool and makes it hard to play with my brother same thing with credit or debit
I like this this game so much but there is a problem of sign but now I can sign in after sign in I love this game very much but there are some glitches and they takes to much time to start.
I love the game or used to its just I have to sign in and the quick chat is so annoying please get rid of it nobody likes it they even make there name quick chat socks and spam it in the chat get rid of it PLEASE
"Great game. Though I wished that it you had a guest account,  you didnt have to randomize your name. Ive tried signing in but it wont let me,  so Im stuck as a guest."
The reason I am giving 2 star is the chat so difficult I am trying find imposters name there are so many name given in the box so difficult it good if we chat no picking name I hate it pls fix it make it in old update
The claimed bugs is fixed feels like a scam because I still got disconnected during games and suddenly being kicked from the room saying Im hacking the room when I dont even know how to code and stuff.
Its not even letting me click on the online game button. It just loads but never actually lets me play. Please tell me whats wrong and Ill write a better review.
"Great game. Theres one problem that Im glad you fixed  There was a problem where you would have to have your parent give you permission to chat and stuff,  and Innersloth removed it. Thank you for getting rid of the permission thing "
I think u shout add a search bar so u can search for players or search for games and u should add more hats for free like bows or hair like straight hair or hair in a bun and maybe tomboy type hair but its a great game
This is an awesome game but just for chatting area we cant defend yourself so its boring now before among us was so good we was loving it but not now.
"This is a good but can you make it so we can write what we want in the chat,  please fix that. Other ways from that. It is a good game"
"My screen freezes whenever i try to sign up,  FIX THIS NOW"
Always new glitches with the game. Yesterday said I didnt have the updated version when I do and constantly getting disconnected.
I was thinking why this was not the number 1 game but mine I do it kicks me out every 5sec when I load on it once I got in a game fineily I got killer then it kicked me out So do not download this game
Its a good game but you can never stay connected for more then ten seconds no matter how hard you try

Actually got quite a bit better graphics are good and the newest update helped a lot. Prolly wont be alive again but its still a good game in my mind
"I love this game but when I tried to sign in but it said faild to sign in please try again later so thats my only problem,  please fix it"
Good game i have played with my friends but when there is a new update every time and in every lobby my games start to lag and not a lit a bunch of lag so i hate that PLZ FIX THIS PROBLEM
i love this game but there is always an issue of reliable packets and it impossible to fix it
Among us is the best game I love it but one problem is that the new spage ship is so slow i am sorry for the complain but you know that this game is the best game ever

This game is really fun but the only problem is that you have to sign in to use free chat you could have censored the abusive words
"This game was extremely fun in the past. We could really enjoy ourselves. Then the update came Quick chat,  need an account to change name,  etc. Pls just bring old among us back ("
"the reviews are highly misleading and critical just because it is a little different now Its still a great game, still use to be better but it is still a good game"
Nice game but I really want the free chat back cus we cant type normally and cant even explain and cant even argue 
Why cant I type in chat is this a bug or a feature the game is good but i need to type on chat please fix it.there is no hate in this review but can you fix the chat please.
I like this game very much enjoyed the game and it have air ship and 15 players but I have only one request please set the chat problem please it have some problem plz  Once more thanks for creating a game like this bye please fix the problem
This actually is pretty good for gameplay and graphic. Since the update when I kill someone I cant move and stuck
Everything is best just there is a glitch that sometimes when a person reports a body several colour body starts coming to screen with heading dead body reported. Pls fix this.
"I hope,  you can change to the old version,  because if the old one has more fun now,  if you change to the old version,  I will give you 5 stars,  thats right Im not cheating"
the new update is cool but I hate they way the updated the chat it is very hard to use especially if the voting time isnt high. kinda ruined the game tbh
This app is great and the new map but I cant type a word its a chosen word and pls innerslot pls just change this this have a lot of issues I cant freely to type I cant explain how did the impostor doing all of my need to say is not is the chosen just pls change innerslot we need free type that...Full ReviewThis app is great and the new map but I cant type a word its a chosen word and pls innerslot pls just change this this have a lot of issues I cant freely to type I cant explain how did the impostor doing all of my need to say is not is the chosen just pls change innerslot we need free type thats the number 1 issue
i would give 5 stars if i could chat normaly i clicked emergency beacause somebody was chasing me cause i cant type somebody said i was sus and i got ejected. and i can only play with 5 players if i play with more it will disconnect me. i want old among us back
"I just downloaded Couldnt play,  I tried many times Same goes with 3 of my friends we tried to play in public and even host but we couldnt"
"Amazing I love this app,  there are a few bugs,  but after this update they dont ruin the game anymore"
"Am having a great time with this game,  especially after their new update,  however,  it says that they added a new clean vents task,  but I cant seem to find it on any of the maps"
It was so fun at first but now they remove the chat and a lot of stuff I wish they add the chat feature it will be much easier
Whats the new update I couldnt comment on anything so because of that I havent played the game in so long it makes it much more frustrating cuz it doesnt give you enough choices for which color you say or which name you say on who you think is imposter and it doesnt let you say your own thing ...Full ReviewWhats the new update I couldnt comment on anything so because of that I havent played the game in so long it makes it much more frustrating cuz it doesnt give you enough choices for which color you say or which name you say on who you think is imposter and it doesnt let you say your own thing  please let people freely speak on among Us again  please 
Please make the chat normal because the updated chat feature is annoying . Actually the game didnt need an update. But still its entertaining and my favorite.
The new update kinda removed the fun and I cant play without a clapped name. A lot of the features are useless and I hope to god the old version is available soon.
I didnt like the new map but they fixed the bugs in it and its good as new Im enjoying the game now and I recommend it
I give this a 45  because the new update that u can talk from your keyboard u have to us the option from the game and I dont know where the words are.
"Right now... For me,  the problem is the chat boxPLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD VERSION OF AMONG US"
It is good but the game still has glitches that need to be fixed.So ever like other 5 games it does it to me.So i would say that it needs a like 23 star review.
I cant play the game without it saying you have to enter an account and when I do its says failed and I cant type in the chat normally i have to use the update chat I hope you could fix these bugs
You made my day worse my dog just died and your stupid game has super long loading screen is making more sad. So remove it
I kinda liked the old animations some time it gets stucked at infinite loop of dead body reported animation.
I mean its a good game but when you guys took away free chat it kinda took to long to talk. Also why are you guys charging us to change our names you guys are really trying to make money what are you going to do next charge me for the game.

Also why are you guys charging us to change our names you guys are really trying to make money what are you going to do next charge me for the game. FTS Im not playing anymore before they charge me for this game
The new update where you cant text anymore is very inconvenient and takes a very long time.
Among us is one of the best games I have ever played and It is in my top 5 in game rating ask number one anyway love your game cant wait for the new roadmap it is going to be fun i can finaly play hide n seek with people without them breaking the rules
I personally love the game but the chat features are awful its so annoying that you cant say stuff to your friends it drives my nuts plz fix it or am deleting it
Not that bad but it sure needs a little fixing ok I mean the chat if we get the original chat and original names then five star s for you
I hate this game this always disconnect me just for sending 6 pings and I really hate it I hope they make an update for this game cause I think is stupid to be disconnected for just 6 pings
"The biggest issue I have,  is people leaving because they didnt get to be an imposter. Other than that,  the game is fine."

Like that we can see when they playing and join faster without the code but dont delete the code just add that we can add friends Family............. Can you do that (if someone finds it helpful please press it was helpful so like that they will know that we need this idea (maby its not my idea) ok so by)
Its good game but every time I tried to join my friends game it says coulded find the time you were looking for but I put the right code .
Perfect except add in the kill animation of red growing a very very long neck and eat the crewmate but only if the imposter is red and also make it so if the vent Is dirty the imposter cant enter it
"I LOVE THE GAME, but i dont like the part where the game kicks you out in the middle of game can you fix that pls thanks )."
The game is tactical and fun as well it takes up time and its a cool game to enjoy.
"I take it back, nostalgia, yes but the update taking long to come, but thats just everyone right now, tell me what games I can play that arent shooting games"
In the next update be sure that u will make a new search button in which we could find our friends game...And also add a new button called add as friend.....please i request you......
Games good except for the goddamn hosts who abuse their power and insta ban you for no reason. Please give us the ability to report servers. I am unable to play the goddamn game because of people banning for no reason.
You cant tell me I cant play for intentionally disconnecting when I just got kicked out from ping.  Needs to be fixed.
I should say its a nice game but the update was not so good and the people are giving only 1 so i can say i you want to save this game then make its as good so the people will know i gave 5 because the people Dont like it at all but the game should go on and who are giving 1 if you have problem t...Full ReviewI should say its a nice game but the update was not so good and the people are giving only 1 so i can say i you want to save this game then make its as good so the people will know i gave 5 because the people Dont like it at all but the game should go on and who are giving 1 if you have problem then delete the gave just dont give 1 and tell bad things adout this gave i know one day this game will be on top
This game is awesome. I like being the imposter it is really fun. and btw the imposter could be a good guy. and the cremate is a bad guy and HACKING the ship. its my lore. to have and its what believe. aways its a good game
"This is a good game,  the problem is there are a lot of hacking during the game,  please try to ban these ongoing hacking,  other than that,  I enjoy it."
This game is well made but this game can be esily boring if you dont have friends to talk with while gaming. Again this game is well made but there is really no story to it
It would be a 5 star rating if not for the chat the way you talk now is hard to do and you cant say stuff you want to say and if you want to say something it might not be on the wheel
I dont like the quick chat its dum and I cant ask for a color and its so confusing cause its hard to find what u wanna say. SO FIX IT INTERSLOTH PLEASE
"Ever since the update the game is now trash. The login system doesnt work,  the chat got DESTROYED and now it crashes a lot. I now hate this game."
Bro this was popular and really fun to play but then it kind of became unpopular again. Part of this is because of the new update which sucks change it man maybe that way people will play it again. The designs good though.
Terrible so bassicly I was playing Among us with my family and everybody (inculding me) were pink bubbles So thats why i never play it because of all that. So please fix it I am begging you.
Hey hate to bother you but the game keeps crashing and I cant play for to long please fix  and love your work
I used to be able to play this game for hours but now since the new update where you cant type in chat I Never play. This game is a wast of storage
Cant join a game with my friends and my brothers wanted to play but we only have a switch and a phone and those cant connect to the same room (this was kinda of why I stopped playing this game months ago)
"At first I could play the game and it not crash,  but now every time I try to play the game crashes so please fix this."
I love this game the only request I have is you add a friends list I make to many friends in that game and I get attached easily (Im weird ik) and I hate it when I have to leave and that friendship goes to waste.

"I love the aspects of this game great job innersloth but I would love to see even more colours in the next update like navy, teal, aquamarine and mahogany"
I love this game but i dont like the quick chat. 1.Who loves among us 2. The quick chat is a terrible idea. 3.the new colors are OK.
"Fix the game,  the new update is trash. No one wants unique accounts,  give us fun easy and simple gameplay. The chat feature is also trash,  ruins the experience."
Before the update. Among us Was so fun to play. Now after the update everything has change. I cannot play the Game always crashed FIX THISSS
HORRIBLE use to love the game I cant even get into a lobby I keep getting disconnected from server. Once issue is fixed Ill give a 5 star
"Nice game Oh yeah something was missing. I dont know if you added this,  When the host goes on game settings,  you can set up the imposter. Edit old reply I dont know what I mean by that "
Amazing game But the game was much more fun when we had free chat.
I used to have a 5 star review but things have changed so much I hate the game sorry to say. Also you should play suspect its way better. EVERYONE UNINSTALL THE GAME THEN THEY WILL HAVE TO TAKE OUT QUICK CHAT
OMGI HATE THIS VERSION.. the first version was soo greater then this one like what is this you cant name by yourself graphics are not better. Btw iam giving it 5 stars because of its old version. 
It is a amazing app. I have enjoyed it a lot . The new version consists many other beautiful colors.
Quite cool I recommend it but... The reason I put 4 stars is because it gets lots of glitches.
This game used to be my favourite Game but after the updates its changesd so much Typing in the chat box is a complex now
It wont let me join a game and it would kick me off the team and the loading screen would just freeze.
"The game has finnaly become useless for me since ive been waiting the innersloth to fix the errors. I think the game deserves to be uninstalled, to add more space for other meaning full games like pub g"
Game is good but. After update We cannot chat freely And it take many time to loading with network and without network. Please remove loading. Plz . Please
This game is fun but I wish that you could tipe by your own again but I really live it there new colors and you can have more people to play with you I rate it 5 keep up the good wor

The game is fun but i hate the fact that it doesnt let me type what i want to say and i hope you guys can change it back to normal where you can type instead forcely or you cant even type a sentence right how you want to type it.
"I love this game but the new in built chat and age verification is unnecessary and annoying,  worst update ever. Please fix and I will give five star"
I dont know why it doesnt let me play. Something about the server but I have uninstalled and installed it back like 8 times and still does not let me play. 
Good game but I think they should have a A.I mode where you can have up to 9 A.I s and then you so theres 10 people in total
This game just got more better because I dont get a lot of glitches or getting signed in. There are not a lot of glitches or bugs.
I used to like this game but not even being able to type your own message is stupid because by the time you work it out everyone has voted like what a stupid update. This is rediclous no wonder why everyone has stopped playing
Its a decent game but the only reason its 4 stars is bc they removed chat and making your own name InnerSloth LLC please bring back chat and making your own name but overall this is a great game it just please fix the chat and and let us make our own name
I give it a 2 because you shouldnt need to pay to use a FREE chat in a game where it is required the chat now is terrible because now I cant get my point across other players
This used to be my favorite game then you ruined it Because the so called quick chat ruined it it used to be fun Because the chatting system used to be fun And names too innersloth ruined it too
Among us has been a boaring game since the chat I cant type all I can say is useless words the game was an amazing game then it got ruined by the safety update also I took long time to change my name also being the impostor is laggy so Id like the processor would be a little low thanks if you read...Full ReviewAmong us has been a boaring game since the chat I cant type all I can say is useless words the game was an amazing game then it got ruined by the safety update also I took long time to change my name also being the impostor is laggy so Id like the processor would be a little low thanks if you read this and pls unable the chat
I downloaded this app today morning at 530 I opened it and its showing like something green coloured figure is running from then and now its 807am but the app dosent open............
Please provide voice enabled. So everyone get chance to talk and keep limit in voice so that anyone can speak only 30 sec . Because problem is with typing in short is difficult and others judge me
The function of sign in has made this game a little boring for the people who havent signed in but other than that it is all great
"The new update is not good because i cant play and i cant type chat , and you need to download the additional recources unlike before you can play directly when you download it, please bring it back"
The game is good but please add a feature to transfer your skins from steam account since i have many skins and pets on my steam account and to make them work in my phone i have to buy them again .
This game is good but chat make thes game bad in old version we can chat anything and it doesnt take long time but now you make bad it take long time and I was bored . So pls make like old version.....
Its good but i just downloaded it when it just updated and i cant play it because it says your using the older version please update now so i was so annoyed but on the first week its working smoothly so i hope you fix that bug.
"Cant type during emergency meetings,  cant join a game even when you type the code right. These new updates are trash"
This game is cool but they keep adding stuff and some stuff is dumb and boring but some stuff is cool so i give it 3 stars.
Among us was my favourite game but when they updated chat system it is difficult to use it so please make as it was.
I used to love this game until the airship update... While the airship map is cool now you have to make an account just to type anything in chat so pls fix this.
"best game ever played i used to play a alot these days with my friends ,  you can connect to you friends and play in private too .... i am loving thhis game"
"Great game I love to play. Best game I ever played . The new colours ,  new dead screen and new airship map is amazing. Keep it amazing INNERSLOTH."
"I did play this a lot,  but the chat function has changed. Pls change it back I rlly dont like it,  and I dont think other people do too."
"They killed this game ,  sign in doesnt work most of the time because the game glitches alot ,  and because of not signing in I cant even chat its so annoying"
Good good game its so amusing but theres only one complaint I cant chat because theres quick chat
"I loved this play before,  i always play it with my friends and my family cause its really good,  but now this suck do we really need to make acc just to change name and free chat Wth plsss bring back the old ones"
The game was great but now it sucks man too many hackers have ruined the fun of the game its almost impossible to play one public game without coming across a hacker Please try to fix this problem
Heres whats wrong ok fixe and then you will get 5 stars as you play the game when the inerslote thing comes on then it crashes before anything happens fix this please this happens on actelect fix it now thank you ) it still doesnt work 
I gave it 1 star because you dont have a free chat and because you cant make your own username you need to pick a random im so disappointed no wonder why the game rating was 3.6.... hopefully you guys will fix it
The game is very fun but the u are limited with words. Making it hard to explain and to communicate.
I like this game so much but when I see reviews so many people say about quick chat so I have we can turn off quick chat first go to settings and go to gernal and u can find it how u turn off quick chat.
The game is great but I stopped playing it as much because of the Eric Loris and Sire Sirol ad bots in every (almost) lobby and I can never join the lobbys
This game was really fun back in 2019 but now the developers have added the auto chat the fun its gone please innersloth remove the auto chat feature or make it optional I request you.
"I love the game but I hate where you cant type and you have to use the options,  and I also hate it when the round ends and the screen turns black."
"This is the best,  but I dont like the update. you cant even type what you want. And you cant type youre name in. Besides that its the best game ever"
I loved the game. But after the update my screen is now completely dark both in lobby and match. Plz fix this Innersloth.
"The game is very simple and good but the quick chat sistem really sucks,  Hopefully the regular chat sistem comes back next update"
I love the earliest way I played among us but when the new update of among us released there was so many problems when I become the imposter suddenly I get disconnected so soon so thats why I give a 1 star
Game is good but game management is worst.... always gets disconnected from game...has done every even to solve the problem but no... always that 6 ping type problem...i just hate this game

Innersloth u really did well u are fixing all the problems many peoples are saying they cant cant chat freely just make an account to do that I likes this game very much I would have given 10 stars if I can )
This is the imposte game i like it but theres some many bugs i see like the players had spawn in skeld bit theres no imposter but i give five star because ist so fun you hide as a crewmate thanks you for building among us dont forget there some sus any where
I hate the new airship update if I could give this a zero out of ten I would The new chat is horrible and I can barely even do anything without getting disconnected.
"Hi,  first of all i cant chat its says me only quick chat For it I am a bit annoyed and its a bit hard to controll So please fix it,  Ty"
"This game used to be so awesome But the chat update ruined it,  Change it back and Ill give it 5 stars."
takes forever to install I had to delete so many apps AND it wont let me download additional assets ALSO it goes black and freezes before I get to the shush screen please fix I love the game but just fix this please 
It is very worse than the earlier and we cant type and we can only use quick chat and with it all the words cant be writtten and it also takes a long time to load
I dont really like the new update like we cant say what we want we need to explain stuff we want to but we have we have a limited words that we can use and it doesnt even let us choose the words well we can shoot the word we want but say how we want only lik
There is a problem when i am trying to play this game then the game disconected from this app and i still unable to play this game.my question is why the server disconnect me from any type of gameplay.
THIS IS SO GOOD I love it but airship glitch on my phone but it is very good AND I LOVEEEEEEEEEE that you can have 15 players yah  and more colors and tablet it phone And the phone is the color of you so cool 100 
Good game but here lately Ive been having trouble playing on my account. Itll log me in and ask me to sign in when I do it doesnt work it feezes.
I used to play this game alot in the past with friends and relatives.Now i barely play because its very buggy and sometimes is crashing.Ill not play this game until its fixed cause its like wasting time.
I know u gonna Jude me but the body reporting thing looked better before and that way the way the characters look now are worse and the voting screen looked better before so what Im saying keep the old textures and just keep the update part I will be very grateful
"Alright so the game got fixed a bit tho you still need to sign in to change ur name and type in chat,  which is boring thats why I didnt add the last star but other than that its fixed for now I guess"
I will give it a 5 stars but sadly there is no new roles yet and it is hard to get imp but its a good game
Its fun but I dont like the new chat its so confusing and cant find the right word in time plus u cant even name urself I had matching names with my bestie (
I love this game but after the last apdate the game be completed it was simple but i cant change my name or play with my friends because i cant change typing mode for no reason after this apdate i became a hater for this game please return back the old setting pleeeeeease.
"This game used to be amazing but with the chat thing it makes it so hard and boring to play ,  please remove it and let us type our selves"
"I liked it i would have give it a 5 if you remove the auto chat. This is the reason game is kinda difficult,  hope you guys remove it quick"

"Cant even loaded a single match,  the screen was dark,  black whenever the host start the game. Bring back the old version "
I hate the new account system. You cant write in the chat without an account. I tried to make an account and the email never got sent 
I love the game but if there was another update with new colours costumes and new maps that would be great thanks
This game was pretty good at the start but the chat system is now trashed I cant even tell easily who the imposter is remove this feature quickly
I love this game this is really good but I hate it because of the quick chat feature please remove it then I will change my review to five star ...
"I liked the original version but this new chat set up is so difficult and boring to use , it makes everything too slow,  had to delete the game"
Once it was my fav game but after update they are asking to download data file assist which is taking a lot time but for me its not even downloading that is the reason I give 1star if you can solve it then we will fell reall good
"Sux,  I download the game,  open the game,  game states I cant play unless I update the game. No update available two seconds after downloading the first time."
Soooo cool the new airship map is soooo huge and amazing But one problem when I try to play with my friends using the code it says there is no such server
Interesting and super game. I like its graphics and quality. Features and tasks are also excellent.
"I dont know why people complain about not getting to talk and change names,  but we all always curse and change bad names. I give this five stars because of it is tons of fun while playing with friends."
They recked it with the whole login and age verification and also i have been sitting for 1 hour and no server terrible i hope they remove so it could like it one was.
It is a good app but you guys should free the pets and hats because people who want to buy the things they can but people whos parents dont allow to buy they cant justsaying other everything is good just add some good maps and good skin colours thats will be great

Its very unfortunate that a once popular game,  ran off its player base. I cant say many will be coming back unless changes are made."
"Honestly this game is not even fun anymore due to the chat system but i guess its not a problem if your signed in,  but still the new chat system is stupid"
The reason is i only gave it a 3 star its because of the quick chat.. yeah its a great game but im only saying this on quick chat im not trying to be a karen but i really want quick chat to be removed its just annoying when you cant say hi to people
I love this game its just so slow to load and can you pls make people have There color even if someone have it and pls make the pets the clothes anything that is for payment free thanks
"This game is very good,  And I really love the airship map,  Can you make the clothingpetshats free I would love to see it,  over all great app."
This apps amazing you can kill crewmates and you can kick out and posters you can press the emergency meeting you can do all different kinds of tasks this is great Ill give it a 100 out of 10
Horrible update Came back after months to recall the memories but instead I got dumb garbage full of scripted dialogue and bugged while entering a match
"To the creators,  Im sorry for my earlier review I didnt realize that there was an option in the settings to change the way I could talk in the app and Ive fixed it now. Im so sorry"
Really entertaining and all but am i the only one getting constantly disconnected 3 stars due to constant disconmects

"Remove auto chat or make changes. Because of it ,  the excitement in game is lost . Please ,  do something"
"Absolutely no strategy. You just hope your fellow crew,  or the enemy doesnt decide to vote you out on a whim. No fun,  no tactics,  just luck based"
i love this game so much You cna play withyour friends and designn your own outfit I defintly recomend this game for all useres It is just over all amzing
Its a very good game but the new update just really made it bad we cannot have names we want to have and text what we want really among us updates are sompos to make it better not worst
Cool but add friend list it will be cool beacuse whenever i make friends in among us theyi leave tje game theyre gone please fix this
I love this game but you cant type whatever you want in the chat it talks too long too ask a simple question
The game is pretty fun now cuz the bugs are fix but I cant click the free chat it wont let me is this a bug Or its just normal but pls I wonna get a free chat
I REALLY hate this update. When the round starts. The game wont even load a single thing Just black. I really need you to fix this situation. I cant play the game like i used to.
"I cannot type in chat nor change my name due to the new update unless I sign in,  which is really annoying. Please remove this update. Thanks."
Update the recent update has added great content. Entertaining and premium quality free game. Only particular players can be offensive.
This app is really fun but the only issue is that you cannot type what you want to say and it gives to options on what to say but the app is really good.
I played this for a while but please make a original Arabic version.. NOT LIKE ENGLISH. many Arab dont understand language English.. Bruhhh. Please do it for us I know youre hard working.. Take your time okay (Im too nervous...)
This game messed up I cant play with my best friends anymore because of this new update. I rate this game a 15... You just lost a player... You suck. Please fix this its too much 
This game is nice....but It discontced every time i played But i like it cuz you can turn cencor on(off freedom of speach)
Ok so it used to be a good game but now you have to make an account and you have to insert your credit card info to make an account if your younger so you have to use the quick chat which isnt quick at all
Love the game. But sometimes when I try to sign in it doesnt work. Even tried reinstalling. Pls fix
I dont like it anymore its dumb you need a email and without it you can choose you name this game is ruendend I hate it now Change the game back to its normal game its better that way...and you have bad random names put some cool name or scary names in there and Ill play your game
This is a great game its a fun pass time but some tasks are tricky and i feel like the free speech feature should be added back i hope my review helps
"Verry nice but when iplay in airship as an impostor it lags very much,  and has many more bugs to fix. By the way excellent game ."
I hate this app they changed and it disconnect me for 5 min and when I went back I played and left and tried to play another server but log me out for 10 more minutes so I give this a 1
Hi. I love the gameupdates. But can you make everything free please. And make more colorhatsmaps and task.one more thing i love the vent task from the latest update. THANK YOU

I use to love this game but when the update came its just like changes everything like u cant chat at all Pls fix it so people can love it back.. (
"This game is really good and you can play with more people but the problem is Im trying to chat but I can Ive tried everything and look on YouTube to but still I cant chat but the is great and I hope more people is going o download this game to,  and Im giving 4 starts good job"
Man before the airship update this game was THE best. Now with the quick chat update and the update where you cant put your names of your choice has made this game horrible. Dont get me wrong its still a good game but the old version was better
Tbh it has got updates from the last months but it just feels like the same the most boring update you guys do is getting new tasks i know having alot of tasks are fun for update but among us littirally adds only one task a month like cmon thats so boring this is why the got boring really fastly lik...Full ReviewTbh it has got updates from the last months but it just feels like the same the most boring update you guys do is getting new tasks i know having alot of tasks are fun for update but among us littirally adds only one task a month like cmon thats so boring this is why the got boring really fastly like who cares about only a task and the maps tho who cares about maps why dont you add for example zombie mode and more nobody cares about another big map tbh fall guys was way better than this game...

"Why isnt the chat update off Please,  remove the chat update. It bothers me so much. It probably bothers everyone. Among us was more fun before...."
Its good now thank for change the update if you will sing in then go to the down settings and tape it then tape quick chat the it will come quick chat or normal its good
A excellent game i love this game but why three star because the we cant do chat by my self like i want to chat 100 sure so i cant please developers if you read it so please i beg you open the chat plzzzzzzz and every body click on yes
Why my additional resources arent getting downloaded ... its just showing the same its not going forward .... please look into it and solve it
This game is fun but sometimes it kinda annoying because sometimes people wont start the game and then it kick everyone out but other than that it really good
Among us has been one of my favourite games i ever liked to play and spend hours playing but now the new update is nice but i cant sign in and why did you guys add guardian among us is not a bad game and i cant sign in because of the guridian thing plz fix this
Its 4 star because the update ruin the fun like u have to have permisiion to change to ur custom name and u have to select a word to speak and i dont like that mame it to opd among us but with some changes like u neec a security check and a password to login
This game used to be decent but now you ruined it with the new chat an account system broke the whole game and now it sucks would give zero Stars
Being able to use emojis and or symbols like _   would make chatting so much more interesting. Especially waiting in pre game lobby
This app is cool but the only thing the ploblem is that there is quick chat it sucks bc some people have family link and they cant sign in no matter what so Im rating this a 3 star
I loved this game but the new version is so annoying they require a account and that other requirements that are so annoying and chatt banning option is also too annoying please fix this
Its really fun and i like investigating but it be nice to be able to talk again instead of a automatic response button thing.
Very good game it was but when the chat update came it became the worse game for me plssss change the chat again because of the chat update I havent been playing this game for 1 year
First thnk you guys for fixing the AUTO CHAT. but I still have one problem every time when the match starts I only see dark. And hear only the sounds. So pls fix it
I cant sign in to my Google play why because they are asking we can also delete your account so I didnt give allow for that so if I try to sign in again its coming error And they are complaining we should sign in so only we can chat with friends So we cant chat with are friends
Ok so I made a review that was negative but we sorted things out and turns out my problems were easily fixable so I highly recommend for you and I hope you think the same when you download it
Cool game but I wish there can be a mode like nice lobbys and bad lobbys when you try to find a public lobby
Its a very good game the only problem is that o cant type my own words but can see other people typing their own words i tried reinstalling but but it didnt work ]
"Used to be a really fun game but now its repetitive with no updates and only kids play it,  I quit ( Also lets not talk about the trash permanent quick chat"
"After few months I downloaded this game back.. Unfortunately I see why the ratings fall..i wish i could play like the first version of this game, but its only left a memories.RIP"
Best game man I just loved it just they have to include a voice chat and the proper message system to proper discuss while playing game with unknown players
The game used to be fun and all but its so annoying now that I always got disconnected.
"The people are annoying,  and they have updated the game in bad ways that make it not fun and boring,  its repetitive,  and I wouldnt recomend this to anyone,  unless I hate them."
I would give it a 5 but when I try to join a certain server by putting in the code at the bottom it wouldnt work but otherwise its a great game Also theres some problems with the airship
I cant connect it always say error try again later when I want to connect to use free chat PLEASE LET US USE FREE CHAT WITHOUT CONNECTING TO SOMETHING
The chat is completely bad they need to fix it back to normal but I never have been the imposter ever so ion know if its a glitch or what.
I love this app but the problem is that my daughter cant play it on her tablet because of the new update. other than that this game is perfect 
This game I cool but. I played it Too many times. But I didnt do imposter role like I played 16.17 Times but I am crewmate. So plz fix it
Good game but lacks some time and takes network alot but its good and fun game for kids to play online with their siblings
Its the best game but since its update i lost interest cause you must choose words from words they give and that takes time i can understand why though cause of tiktoks people make with the game still though great app
Online gameplay has become frustrating. Too many trolls trying to prevent others from having fun
Its a good game and I edited this but I dont give it 5 starts cause innersloth said they would put free chat back on but once I did that I tried to turn it on but it does not let me so I need to know how to turn it on
"I do not like how they made predetermined sentences,  it made the game harder to play and looking for the right words take too much time."
It is a good game but if you are young it says your parent or guardian has to PAY MONEY to get free chat which is so anoying
I like this game because like you get a chance to be an imposter and kill and imposters can also vent and sabotage so I realy like a amung us I would be dead if amung us was not a game like I would not know what to do with my frickin life if amung us was not a game
Its fun but this new update really ruins the chat its so slow and inefficient its literally a game of who can blame who first because its hard to make up a response in time during voting
"This game is Soo Fun Iam Addicted to this now i love it when you get to Work with your friends and Betrayal, I love neing inposter too, Especally crew mate LOVE THIS GAME Edit i just want to request..Could you guys remove the quick chat,  cause im having trouble.."
It is a waste game now but before it was awesome new options came and it became waste. We cant type what we want and no one will belive. Dont play this game.
Its simple they make their oen game terrible hackers every server you can be kicked as host somebody of every language is in English servers do that can can fixed I lister a few problems but I could go on FIX YOUR GAME
I really love this. I get to play with my friends and siblings. I really think this is a Great game for everyone. It has improved so much. Love it.

It make you download something that takes FOREVER and take up so much storage. This game use to be so fun and had to make everything complicated
"Its a fun game,  but I dont like that you need Google play to create an account. Other than that its very addictive and fun to play with friends."
I still keep getting disconnected from the game almost every single round and its getting extremely annoying. Please fix.
I love the game but can you make it ware you can type again please but other than that can you Add more free skins please and can you make a app for Among us ware you can have a speaker so you dont always have to type please.
This game was so amazing. I give 5 star cause Idk how to say. This game was cool.But please clear all ads 
Awesome game but has one problem why do I always get banned or kicked In random servers please fix that anyway thank you
This game used to be great but now theyve added so many updates that it sucks and you cant chat if you dont sign in which is absolutely barbaric
Its good. But when the emergency button gets pressed it keeps freezing.but besides that it was amazing
Ummm I love this game btw the only way to disable the quick chat is to sighn in by doing an email. Oh and this is my favorite game even tho the quick chat ruins the game LOL 5 stars btw.
Back to 5 stars as Im dumb and it wasnt working cause my google play account was being weird and it wasnt cause of the game. Keep working hard the games great
I played this game before it got popular. It was really fun but now with the new updates and that you need a google account to play sucks. Was better before
This game was once a grate game. And.. it is still a great game but it dose have few glitches but it is worth 5 stars and i recomend u guys to play it )
Love the game caught it late but thanks to covid we got to learn about this game again.. updates great chat thingy idk and I been getting kicked off server but other than that its ok
"This game keeps saying that Ive disconnected from the server which is rather annoying,  it would be a great game if it actually let me play"
I love this game but I wish u could send pitch8res and stuff and also when u die or finish your task u can help the people who are still alive like give them clues
I like the game before but the chat is now so bad I cannot even do a simple 100 iq now a days so many people hate the chat some people is leaving the game just because of the chat update like seriously if your reading this can you just  the bad words like is the only way Im playing among us again ...Full ReviewI like the game before but the chat is now so bad I cannot even do a simple 100 iq now a days so many people hate the chat some people is leaving the game just because of the chat update like seriously if your reading this can you just  the bad words like is the only way Im playing among us again I well not be playing it anymore I well play it again well the chat is like the old one SO BYE
Its is a very good game but sometimes the host takes a really long time to start the game.
"I really dont like this update,  you cant type like you used to and its hard to find your statement,  also you cant change your name and it has to be a random name,  its wierd for me and I dont like the update in general."
Among us is a good game but the animation show you like a small players and there is a problem that there hackers and they still there And I enjoyed more on the old game on 2020 the game is putting more players 15 and there is 3 imposters still
The game itself is very good but they changed the chat box. But still its an amazing game.
I really liked that game and it is so cool ....but there is a problem first the update is so bad and we cant even chat so please fix all of the problems in among us

It was an amazing game but now because of the new update the chat is annoying i can never say what i want to. I would have reccomended this and i still do but its not as fun
But in next update you have to add new modes and a new meeting type just like emergency meeting and body reporting and one more you have to add imposter checkmate unless I will uninstall this game
Theres new glitch or bug or something if someone click the emergency thing and body reported showing up thing happens it never ends
"I dont understand the update You should be able to chat yoursef and make your own name I like the among us in Roblox better than this. Please fix it. Other than that,  great game."
"Bring back the old chat system where you could freely speak,  its a lot easier and less confusing"
I loved this game at first and now I just cant with it. I cant type anything in the chat. It just isnt fun anymore.
"Game is cool... Chat sucks really bad,  it is the core gameplay mechanic making it really frustrating and causing communication problems and lack of strategy Please fix it"
You cant turn off the quick chat before logging in. This is not good. Please fix it. This quick chat thing is ruining my experience.
I want only 2 things 1. That we can chat with out any log in 2.That when I sign in I am entering guardian email but it is saying that error Thats the thing that irritate
"Ok now this game is garbage, nobody wanted quick chat or signing in, i really wished the accont thing never came out and the airship was the only thing that came in this update, either remove the quick chat and sign in account thing and let us make our names NORMAL again or do nothing and let us have a...Full ReviewOk now this game is garbage, nobody wanted quick chat or signing in, i really wished the accont thing never came out and the airship was the only thing that came in this update, either remove the quick chat and sign in account thing and let us make our names NORMAL again or do nothing and let us have a horrible among us exprience, please fix thing Please And thank you"
"Its overall better,  you can type again,  but Im trying to use a cromebook and it wont let me use the keyboard to move around. Is there a way I can use the keyboard Im pretty sure that its user error but I dont know."
It is is a fun game but however I wish I could choose my own name I get that your trying to make this kid friendly(I am a kid 2) dont get me wrong but you should like make it stay like the old version but it is a great app love it but it needs some help.
"I like the game,  but every time the match starts,  I only get a black screen. It works in every lobby. Pls fix it Innersloth."
When I join a game and when it start s I get a black screen it s not fun it happens on My Huawei p smart 2021 I dont know why but that s all I hope you fix it in the next update game great
The messaging is so dumb now. So hard to write anything. Maybe you need to make clean and unclean options for bad language etc. This is horrible trying to write something in about who you are with. Makes the game terrible.
It was fun at first but when the new update came it just made it pretty bad and confusing to chat.
Hi I rate this game a 5 star  because it a really good game but I liked the old among us where we could easily chat to the over people and it easy to play the game like that so pls change it back 
"Ngl man,  for the vent,  you guys should make it that you only see whats under there and everyone on top not visible,  it would make more sense and would make players more cautious Lol"

this game is really cool... but the problem is why did i get 50 crewmate straight is it cuz unlucky or bug... but its ok this game is still fun
"Very buggy,  lots of hackers and no support for colorblind players. Great concept,  terrible execution."
I used to play this a lot but i uninstalled it for sometime and now when I reinstall it just ask for downloading data and agreeing to the polices but then doesnt move past the loading page
"Well well well,  Innercking sloth when I tried to join a lobby,  It said that I disconnected ackd (1919ms) and I couldnt even create a single game. I tried several times but couldnt. Fix this damn issue."
I had some trouble finding how to free chat all you have to do is log in. This game is great if you can free chat and i recomend it.
This game used to be fun but now you need to create a account for some reason which is just annoying.
I use to really like this game but now the new update is anoying me I dont like it that we can only chat by choosing the words I want to write words instead
Good but my friends think this is a boring game but i think its very good but i gave you 4 stars because we cant change name to change name we have to do connect with something
I love this game but I have a request make a new update where we can have voice and video chat and they are many hackers in the game so please check that
"The reason that I gave it a 3 is because they updated to where you have to sign in add stuff,  and you cant even pick your own name if you change that 5 stars"

Such a bad experience first of all there are so many hackers and secondly I have not become impostor since 10 days I have played like 2530 games and still i have not become impostor. I had heard really good about the game but Im very disappointed.
Pretty simple game not too bad the only bad thing about is is that air mship takes a bit to load
The new chat system is trash. I thought to play this after a long time but turned out it is ruined. Uninstalled the Game. Come on pls fix it.
"I cant even download this,  once I click the install button it looks like its installing then when it reaches 100 it restarts and I click it again and again and again it just doesnt work"
"Some reviews mostly complain about the quick chat but you can still chat freely if you have an account,  just sign in"
I love this game although the quick chat is sometimes annoying I got used to it. And the names were very creative.
Its a good game but sometimes it lags or it wont load. Its fun to play with others. The art is cute.
Its an okay game but the games dead no one plays it any more but still a very very enjoyable game and yes its fun to play when you are bored
The game is only good when we sign in because then we can change the name and write anything in the chat otherwise without signing in this game is hopeless so thats why I gave it 3 starts
hi so im on chrome and when i go on settings itr only says thumbstick or touch screen and its rlly hard to move when i have to drag your cursor to move 
"Its a murder mystery game,  though at as like a playful style to it. I personaly think its great 5 stars"
ok one the new update is so bad you cant even chat to other people be cause you cant I have among on my ipad and computer so when i play with friends but i can only type on my computer thats what i use for my calls fix this update i dont like it and other people dont to
Ok game but pls add audio chat option . It is really hard to communicate between the people.
I luv this game but there is only one problem that we cant type in chat box otherwise this game is very good
Thing happens where the app keeps crashing and the only way to fix it is to uninstall and reinstall. This of course resets your stats and In the future may reset achievements. Has happened about 5 times since the May 12 update.
Its a good and fun game but its scary when u get murdered when u have headphones on and u have them on full volume.AND INNERSLOTH CAN YOU PLEASE ADD FRIEND REQUESTS
"I like it a lot but you need to stop these hacks,  last time hackers came to server and made 5 imposters instead of 3 and also closed the server after the match"
I dont really play any more cuz of the chat its really boring I would like If u fix it I really hate the new update idk why they took chat away but can yall fix it I see the game almost has more 1 star so I really dont like it
I like the game but i like the old way to where you can type any name and u can type whatever you want.

But its a good Game I ever seen .... Bruh... I tried uninstalling and installed but I cant getring inposter argh.. in new chat all are talking bad words
Game was good before the update with the chat at this point it isnt playable because people just vote randomly
"Im sure all of you can agree,  this game is amazing. Finding out the killer,  putting your skill to the test. Totally a fan favorite."
Ugh  maybe hacked Like ads come on by the way when were joining the game mine takes FOREVER to load also its a bit bad.
This game is amazing and perfect for travelling only if u date or wifi but a great way to spend time with family and friends overall review I give it a five star try it now
The game has just gotten worse and worse and they need to add the chat back and make things like the way they were
Nothing so much very like before the update because we couldnt chant quickly like before so you have to change the mode of this game so that we could play the game like before with full enjoyment and happiness
The game was great before airship update....but the update ruined the game....the quickchat is useless....even though the 15 player mode is great....but i didnt like the airship map
This game is fun. Those guys who are unable to chat please login to game. It will enable the chat
"Amogus Anyway,  the game is good,  but please remove quick chat. Its much slower than chatting normally,  and the system can easily be bypassed by faking your birthday."
Okay listen I am really sorry really sorry to say this I dont like a chat cuz we cant type whatever we want anymore sorry. Also I dont know why but when I press find game it takes for ever to load.
This is good game but the quick chat make harder to convince someone and that why i give 4 star because the quick chat is make it harder

Why I cant seem to find myself to accuse someone properly and to defend myself when needed be,  just yeet all the way,  be it am being accuse or am reporting someone,  YEET (Are we being forced to play mic on Cause that is the only way I could think of to compensate for the chat configuration. Thank you.)"
"When the update came,  I didnt like the game anymore. First,  you cant create your own nickname and second,  you cant chat freely."
Yo people that thinking safe chat is that is probably all kids because you could just put your credit card info and thing you can talk normally can literally turn off sensor I dont understand how many people are saying oldest safe chat you can turn it off
theres this one glitch where when sometimes a player talks the color is like some sort of bright yellow and the words are not on the line please fix that
Please Please Please Remove the quick chat option Its so ANNOYING do not limit the chat this action is awful But I like this game
"Nice game,  love the graphics and I recommend it. change my mind,  the old version was better"
I love the new upgrades of among us but I do not like 2 of the upgrades I dont like the upgrade where you cant write your own name and the 2nd upgrade I do not like is where the body report is there or emergency meeting is there it takes forever to search for the word what you are finding for when...Full ReviewI love the new upgrades of among us but I do not like 2 of the upgrades I dont like the upgrade where you cant write your own name and the 2nd upgrade I do not like is where the body report is there or emergency meeting is there it takes forever to search for the word what you are finding for when its body report or emergency meeting gets finished Intel you are still trying to search for the word so please remove the upgrade where you have to search the word for in the chat
"Keeps disconnecting when i have literally real fast internet....whats wrong ..fix it already,  cos among us is disappearing amongst us already"
"It is a great game. Though,  I dont really like the fonts. They are too bold and I liked the old ones better."
among us isnt fun anymore i liked more when we had among us in 2020 and its becuse the chat was better then becuse now you have to pick words and none them proof your good and then you get easily voted off by adding a little thing and the hole game got ruined it was my favorite game but Now its all ...Full Reviewamong us isnt fun anymore i liked more when we had among us in 2020 and its becuse the chat was better then becuse now you have to pick words and none them proof your good and then you get easily voted off by adding a little thing and the hole game got ruined it was my favorite game but Now its all developers fault now among us is less popular and this go to everyone thats among us liker and olso the developer
"Im not able to enter any game. This is so ridiculous,  please bring the old version back. this new version is terrible"
"Quick chat has ruined rhe game for me,  all the bugs where tolerable to some degree ,  but this completly killed it for me as an android user."
I like it can u add a new feature please for being a security or be the imposters assistant. Thank you for this amazing app.
I played among us when the new update happend and i got rid of the game then got it back but now the game wont work it will get me to the menu but not the public games even hosting the game it wont work plz fix it
This game was good i played all the time but since the new update it loads longer and The quick chat sucks bring back keyboard please
This is a great game only the fact that you cannot chat what you want and the fact that you cannot change your username please add that back thats all I want thank you I really love the game tho
"What nonsence game this is coming after the imposter its coming its showing 6 ping and ping is 120 how its showing high ping,  crewmate is coming and is ping low why is come out nonsence idiot game and I love game more and delvoper should clear the bug......"
Ok I really hate this update of the quick chat and of the randomise name There is no use of it Just take off this new update its making people stop playing the game among us.
I saw this movie about this no visor guy and that gave the creeps in this game but i still like the game. Oh and the chat its very hard to have a normal conversation.
"The previous,  original one was like a million times better...this one needs email etc. Which makes it suck"
This game is really good but its going everyday boring and this game is not intresting now and first main reason so I am leaving this game is people everyone want rules like him kickban future is the worst thing of this game so I request to among us createars please make among us again better and ...Full ReviewThis game is really good but its going everyday boring and this game is not intresting now and first main reason so I am leaving this game is people everyone want rules like him kickban future is the worst thing of this game so I request to among us createars please make among us again better and why I have given among us 3 star reason is people and some fuctions so this is my review thanks
This is the best game ever. I love to play it and the auto chat is the best thing. The tasks are very nice keep it up 
"This is the third time Im writing a review lol,  I just have to say I really like the new update so far,  new colors and bug fixes everything is cool,  and its probably the best update of among us so far."
EVERYONE WHO RATED THE GAME 1 STAR BECAUSE YOU CANT CHAT AFTER THE UPDATE YOU CAN. SIGN IN THE GAME AND PUT YOUR AGE 19 OR 20...I saw a ton of reviews complaing about this here is the solution to your issue. Downloaded after a long time EXCITED
Use to enjoy it. But apparently reporting does nothing. Trolls. Teaming. Cant enjoy it anymore. I get so pissed. Make your reports actually do something.
What hell its keep disconnect when game start or booth out the servers When someone chatting Please dont dowload it Its
"Even if I mistakenly close the app for 0.5 second,  It removes me from the game saying disconnect. I would recommend to fix this problem as soon as possible"
"Fun paranoia filled times,  but starting to have a problem with hackers. Or glitches. Both Cant tell sometimes."
Game is awesome but there is one problem everyone is a jerk now they ban you in every lobby I got banned from lobbys for no reason they instantly ban you whenever you join 3 row ban for no reason fix please
"This is overall amazing ,  people do get rude in chat but we can kick or ban them which also nice ,  I would really like if theee were new maps in it 3"
"Ah my friend it has been good i know its good cause now i can free chat (only with glitches) but yeah i can tho 5 stars for this 1 star for crewmates that dont trust you so yes make new maps better than airship future updates And i got something else if you want mods go check put skeld.

Net for new mods. Here are the mods cops and robbers,  town of us,  venteleporter,  escelation,  and more i cant tell how much but check it out Also if you want free chat too download google plays. Bye"
Ever since they only allowed you their choices on what to say its been pretty terrible. Its hard to navigate and you cant say what you want fast. Just not as fun anymore
Its hard to say but the new chat update is so annoying but otherwise it would be a good game change the chat thing please because I will rate it 5 star
"This game sucks,  I got disconnected most of the time in middle of the game. Needs lots of improvement."
This update made among us not fun because its only 2 stars because nobody can understand anyone how do anyone play among us if you cannot understand anyone now among us in not fun anymore )
I love this game..but I think it will be more perfect if you can add friends..but its a good game
"Its a cool game its fun to play with friends,  but I dont like the new among us I like the old because too many update but its fun to play"
I gave it one star because we cant play with our friends I have told this many time but u didnt fix it fix it or I will uninstall the game what the heck I even doesnt want to give a star but I have to and we cant chat also
I LOVE THIS GAME except for the new chat I am always voted out when I see the imposter vent because of it I can not type fast enough now I dont play as much
"This game used to be popular but now mmany people stopt bcs of the quickchat and how long it takes to load into the game (you get killed INSTANTLY) and bcs of the email parents thingy so please change it back (, (PLEASE READ THIS AND REAPPLY)"
Best game ever always playing this but one thing left is micso I req you if you can add mic to this game so we can play it with more fun
This GAME IS VERY NICE AND VERY INTERESTING BUT THERE IS A PROBLEM THAT IF THERE IS NO INTERNET IN HERE SO THIS GAME WELL NOT WORK SO PLEASE DO WITH INTERNET ALSO AND EVEN NO INTERNET SO IF OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAVE A POWER CUT SO THAT EVEN THEY CAN PLAY THANK YOU
"I would used to love this game alot and would daily play it. But now this game is stupid because of the update of chat,  do not install this game its no use of playing without free chat"

Its a very good game but the reason I gave it a 3 star because I had to download another app Called Google play And try making my account But it doesnt work And I have to use auto chat But its a good game I love it
"Ok. Great skin and cool hats,  but I cant chat and got disconnected many times in a middle of a game"
I used to love this game i still do but they could add the airship without the chat thing and also i cant see anything i cant play as imposter or crew

Hacker knowed who was the imposter he clicked the emergency button 3 times and said who is the imposter he was correct all the three times and the imposter only killed one crewmate then how he knowed who three was im.
Update dont download this game They updated it and removed the chat we cant even talk correctly and the meetings end so fast you really messed up a feature now among us is dead
Actually I love this game but the games just allow me to be crewmate but not an imposter because I have rated 3 stars and this game is very enjoyable
"I cant play everytime I try joining a game it goes all black,  I cant even see anything or whats happening.. idk but it sucks,  I wish it works its fun to play but its... All black"
Love this game very interesting and addiction game in low size but it have still some glitches so I am giving 4 star
I realy liked the 1 st beta of this game but now its got worse and worse i now cant. Even log in to it and i paid money on it for dlcs
Love the game its fun and all that but when we try to play local the game stuck on loading... we cant play local anymore and we need a account to play now thats suck...
"The new update is sooooooo bad ,  they players were guiltching and walking on walls ,  and the game never ends its just a black screen in the end"
". The safe chat update is honestly not that bad,  at least for me. Its a really nice game and I have played it for a long time ."
This Game was so good and fun until the update it RUINED IT you cant change youre name you have to be over a certaint age to free chat if under that age you cant chat freely. 
"No way to connect a steam and mobile account,  the mobile account system is a pain to deal with,  among other issues."
This is a very nice game.I am realy enjoy the game.But this game a many problem. I think game problem reapiaring in this Game owner.So please first reapiaring this game please.
It was fantastic in 2020 in summer but now with the updates I dont really like it and I cant login for sum reason and I cant text chat
really good game the imposter animation is really good now its never lags and its also gets you to play for hours.
I loved the game but now we cant have are own chat And ik why but its hard bc some people dont know how to use it I loved it before
So um i played the game but 1 i need to chat normal be you add quick chat and i dont want quick chat i want normal chat And 2 it is glichy and it was like i cant see my among us caracter because of you plz fix this plz like the new intro game of among us but fix it NOW PLZ CHANGE IT INTO NORMAL PL...Full ReviewSo um i played the game but 1 i need to chat normal be you add quick chat and i dont want quick chat i want normal chat And 2 it is glichy and it was like i cant see my among us caracter because of you plz fix this plz like the new intro game of among us but fix it NOW PLZ CHANGE IT INTO NORMAL PLZ NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW btw the screen is black when i join the host plx FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIX
The is nice and all but you cant type what ever you want why what is this a educational game to fine the imposter we say what we want not what the words the game says we must choose and do we have to say the username or the colour of the player

But only one freaking thing,  disable the fg throw out of game option thats why I hate this fg game so fg much .sorry I dont usually swear but still 3 TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT ( Dumb thing...) Also I barely get imposter which makes me more frustrated  UNINSTALLING NOW"
It good and all but there just needes to be more work on the app 1.they should add a friends list 2.add a age limit because there names if yk u yk but over all its good 
Nice job also for some players who say they entered the exact code and it said didnt find the match check if u r connected to the same server
it was a great game. but I always get updates late. My fav roll is the imposter roll. the tasks are cool too.
"I really like the but the new chat feature is not that great,  by the time I find what I want to say the voting is over."
When your the imposter or cremate then the crewmate Has to complete the ship or if your the imposter then you have to kill crewmates On the ship and the maps are the skeld mira hq polis and the air ship and last of all submerged but it only comes out in 25 of June but weve had June the 25 of2020 bu...Full ReviewWhen your the imposter or cremate then the crewmate Has to complete the ship or if your the imposter then you have to kill crewmates On the ship and the maps are the skeld mira hq polis and the air ship and last of all submerged but it only comes out in 25 of June but weve had June the 25 of2020 but I have the Halloween hats but not the Christmas ones but get me them thank you Sam barron 87 thank you for letting me know
"Some people leave the game when they get crewmate role. Its really annoying at some point. If you can do something to avoid it ,  Ill give 5 stars"
so good ads are fine i just dont get imposter most of the time you habe to bye pets and stuff to get the but otherwise the game is so good
This game is super fun but theres 2 glitches that make it unplayable (sent 6 pings that remote could not respond to and was not acked)
"I love this game but please fix it typing. Its very hard to find the words, i cannot type what I want so please FIX IT."
"Im very disappointed in this update i was so excited for the airship map then you guys changed up the chat,  and its ridiculous if you didnt wanna hear a word just bleep it out ,  its ridiculous you have to pay 50 cent for a name ,  and pick a name for it Bro what"
It use to be super fun until the quick chat was in the game and now we cant really chat and it will mostly make no sense so can you remove quick chat
The best multiplayer game and teamwork game but the problem is we cant free chat Or voice chat without song in so please make the free chat free without sing in or enter voice chat and that also without sign in then I will give 7 stars 
An online free game with no ads Thats amazing but the dilemma is the new update after releasing the airplane map...
This is amazing but only problem is that it makes me leave midgame and it says my internet is bad but I check and its normal.
The only thing I dont like is that you cannot fix the imposters sabitog when you are a ghost and you cant fix your own sabitog when you are a ghost
In this update when I host a game my friend type the same code and it is saying that could not find the game youre looking for please fix it
The servers are in so little places that I cant even go in game with decent interent. So I just play Clash Royal instead.
Super game and i putted a review and developers answer that quickly i m glad about service . And this game is suitable for everyone .sorry if there are wrong english 
Its fun no ads interrupting you game while your playing like maybe your a imposter while playing and a ad pops up no that doesnt happen no ads whatsoever
Sometimes lags me out even when Im getting 20 ping thats why Im giving it 3 stars fix that so Ill do 5 stars
"Me being so into games andor gaming Im always on the latest new trend,  although among us looks so much better on other players devices. With or whether I may just be unlucky idk"
Its a good game and I think it would be great if you could add some more new maps unlike the airship and the submerged map
1. Doesnt let any chats 2. Doesnt let you join 3. Doesnt let you host WORST.GAME.EVER if you want to play among us install ROBLOX and type it in and bam youre playing the game.
I loved the game before the update now u cant even type to vote people out u have to search for stuff so if u can change this back to how it was before pls do this is just ANNYOINGGGGG
Would give five stars but I dont like how you have to sign in to change your name or you cant type to tell your crew mates by the time you finished with the dialog thing you dead voted out change this now pls

Its a good game and very very fun to play with friends only the chatting update is very annoying I stopped playing

Well it used to be good but now the graphics are bad and you have to sign in to put your own name or something pls pls put the old version back 
Horrible we should be able to chat freely again now all people do is vote random and we cant explain where we were or even lie AND THATS WHAT THE GAME IS ABOUT I WOULD PUT 0 STARS BUT ITS NOT POSSIBLE
Good game..would be good if there was a way to add people as friend like in a friend book...then you could invite to play with any time
In first i loved this game but the quick chat is soo hard too chat i cant find words and some word arent even there that i have to use plss we want the old chat
Very entertaining game with lot of cool stuff within ittt.. id say this is one of the best games where you can enjoy together with your frnds
It so much fun I love the feet taping but is there a button where they pressed it so they stick to the ground can you make a mod where they float
Among us use to be a fun game we could choose our own name and chat whaterver we wanted but the only problem i have is that why did you change it among was nice before you changed it now its boring my brother and I cant play it and have fun plss give us our old among us back the airship can stay and...Full ReviewAmong us use to be a fun game we could choose our own name and chat whaterver we wanted but the only problem i have is that why did you change it among was nice before you changed it now its boring my brother and I cant play it and have fun plss give us our old among us back the airship can stay and the new coulours and hats but i i want is to type whatever i want and to choose my own name plsss plssss plsss plssss pls plsss plsss plsss plsss just let us type what we wanna type
"Its harder to find servers even when I have a good connection,  and it always pops up with an error"
"I hate the new version I cant even type whatever I want whoever made the new sucks,  I hope they change it back to the old version"
So when I first downloaded the app it was fine I could join a friends game and do all sorts of stuff but now when I create a game the code doesnt even show up nor can I even join my friends game like I updated the game and everything and still doesnt show the code or I cant join a private game
It really annoying that you say you fix the android black screen bug and obvious it still happens please fix and the update will not download 3 hours nothing sooo loong
Gameplay is good I just want free chat back cause sometimes you have to say something but you cant in mobile

"Its a realy good game but realy should bring back chat cause all the trollers have left which is good,  but it was alot easy with free chat"
This game is good but I an get boring. I think this game needs a lot more updates I dont know any specific updates but updates that will make this game better
I use to play this game a tone and I would love it I was have so much fun until one day I came on to play among us and I couldnt type so please fix that really want to chat again so please please fix it Im so sad now I cant chat and I really want to chat again so just fix that its all I want if ...Full ReviewI use to play this game a tone and I would love it I was have so much fun until one day I came on to play among us and I couldnt type so please fix that really want to chat again so please please fix it Im so sad now I cant chat and I really want to chat again so just fix that its all I want if you would please fix that
"This game is fun and all but changes need to be made like more free hats and free outfits like,  nobody wants to spend 3 for a dumb outfit"
"Great Game. I Love it,  Heard People Complaining about safe chat. Just Make An account. Not that hard. Get a brain people"
I was giving 5 stars  but what the hell the developers themselves ruined the game with (quick chat  guest name) im giving 1 start until everything will be back
"Love it. Stop about the chatting issue. They wanted to prevent ant and all offensive things to say. they are doing whats best for the game. dissapointed that you all must complain about that,  this game is great,  yet you all complain about such little things."
Wow that was a great game but I need imposter to enjoying .you can update the game 4 to 15 players to 4 to 1millon player
"I cant download the additional assets,  why tho and i cant play when the game is started,  its just black screen,  i hate this game now."
"The game is fun but you cant change your name anymore and you cant play without an email or playing as a guest, its not as fun as it used to be"
I LOVE IT. The only problem is that I can only type a few words. What if I want to team with someone Answer I cant without signing it.
"I uninstalled this game few months back and downloaded it yesterday and when I click find game it takes so long to load and the game is slow,  I didnt get to play any game cus it takes so long to load please fix"
"This game was fun until they updated the chat,  please let us type again Also change the animation when you slow down"
"I cannot play anymore,  it tells me I have an unstable internet connection. Whick sucks because I really like the game. Please fix it."
It is very good but the new feature quick ruins the game you have to sign in to use free chat except that everything is good
It use to be a 5 star then they added new things like the quick chat and sign in so that made it a 1 then they fixed some of that stuff but not all so it is a 3 (average)
I want the keyboard for chatting and many of players leave the game so please fix that any player once enters a game could not leave it until it ends
It is the best if the speed chat is your problem then sign in then you can chat without you know selecting words and all yah it is the best like always
I love this game but i cant give it five stars because since the update the lag is horrible
I like it but every time I put in the code to join my friends game it says I have to change the settings or something to where it works and yes I tried that and nothing happened it said the same thing
Fix the chat please and then I will give you a five star s but until then Im not coming back.
Its a good game but I cant type In the chat I have to use the easy chat but I get ejected so it needs to be fixed or I wont change this rating
"Very,  very fun but not so sure about how the new update signing in is. Alot easier not using the gmils and things like that"
I love the game the only problem is the chat you cant say stuff that you want to say so it makes it boring
I really used to love this game but after the chat its been very bad.i hate the new chat update. I hope they fix it.
"if it had better matchmaking it would be a 5 star review also this game needs some new game modes,  while fun it can get repetitive quickly"
"This us really good but please out the orginal tab in it and let us write our name and also please remove the chat box that we have in the game,  let us write our own statements during the game i hope u guys will fix it"
"Keeps giving a disconnected from server everytime I try to join,  I used to love this game ) sad"
"You guys should fix your game. Their are tons of hacker that anyone cant even play like normal.And also when a player was a imposter hacker tell that everyone vote him, but when hacker was imposter he hack the game and win. That was so annoying."
I miss the old among us.. With the update I CANT EVEN SIGN IN its saying (Error GoogleAuthNoTaken) like what even the fps is low no.innersloth..like plz its been 3 months Ive given it 3 starts cuz i cant sign in
It is a GREAT game but there is one thing... In airship i dont like how u cant clear yourself or ppl clear you and quick chat is also annoying can u atleast add normal chat AND quick chat
I love the game its a really cool game but by chatting with crew members freely would be fun just like it use to be
This game is actually epic but the chat is weird but still 5 stars.i love the tasks so play this game and dont use the chat if you want
It gets fun once your the imposter...I recommend personally this game. The quick chat is a little irritating but the rest is good
Please remove anything that can block vent ways. I got notice cuz got stuck in something next to the vent
I liked the Among Us where you didnt have to sign in using email now you do... Its just stupid
"It wont let me join my sisters game because of quick chat,  quick chat isnt even quick I hate this game what did intersloth do Dont install"
Always fun to play this game. I dont recommend it for children. The PC version is dope too
This is a very nice game but l dont know why it changed you cant even say that someone vented or someone killed its so hard to say something
The list of players in chat option has become messy as it shows names of left players also.....fix it and make it like old version
Game crashes and glitches after new update. 2021 Game doesnt start at all now.
Sorry for being rude.the game glitches while clinking on multiplayer.i played the game when it was released.it changed a lot its awesome.but some glitches.i stopped play because of the chat and glitches
This game was amazing in 2020 but the developers have ruined it by adding to updates especially the chat its terrible we just asked the 15 lobbies and more colour not the QuIcK cHaT thing . Please change it to the original chat system
Really good game again bugs patched and Goooooood game I love how they patched all the bugs you should play it for sure
"This game is fun,  but I have a little problem. People that are not signed in cant change quick chat please fix this."
I was showing my friend how to get the freechat in among us but when i freaking tried to sign in it told me i couldnt and i uninstalled it delete the quickchat update it does not help with the swearing issue plus censor mode is good enough im never playing until you get rid of quick chat
I use to like this game but since chat has changed to choosing not putting what you are thinking. I think they should change this now
When among us got famous that Version was good where we could chat. This version is boring because Its too complicated to discuss among the teammates 
This game is rlly fun the thing is i dont like the chat cuz trying to tell anyone where or what quick is not possible even if ur not ok with the wheel of chats can u change that its rlly getting annoying
This needs to be 5 stars but there are lots of hackers. Every time I become imposter they hack. Pls fix this. Or I have to uninstall the game.
Everythings fun besides getting disconnected randomly and I cant sign in when I try it says error and for me to try again later its very annoying

This game is good but nowadays when i am typing something in the game the game disconnects. Please fix this issue.
This game is not fun anymore ever since this update i have no fun playing i cant even talk or say what I want i have to go off of a annoying choice chart to speak or communicate im already fast at typing and found that update unneeded i am not rating it 1 star because the game looks good but has bad...Full ReviewThis game is not fun anymore ever since this update i have no fun playing i cant even talk or say what I want i have to go off of a annoying choice chart to speak or communicate im already fast at typing and found that update unneeded i am not rating it 1 star because the game looks good but has bad features.
"A fun time filler,  well worth the extra couple of dollars to purchase and support."
This game is awesome before the airship update it was so trending but now this game has changed alot you cant type anything you want you cant just type your name you want pls bring back those...
The game is good but its the updates like quick chat that is horrible because you cant even say I her she his he unless its somebodys name which you cant even do because you need to randomise it AND THE NAMES ARE TERRIBLE I HATE THIS FING GAME
This game is mostly good but one thing that I would so bad about this game is that you have to login and how much of a pain it is.
This game is awesome I have ever tried it. I installed it again but when I tap it to play it goes back to home screen and that annoys me so much so kindly fix it.
This game keeps on kicking u out of the server.Dont download this game cause u hardly get chance to play one game. its not worth wasting data for. And the new auto chat is horrible 
Tip I like among us a lot because its cool when your the imposter you have to kill crewmates and sabotage when your the crewmate you have to check the imposter map be careful sometimes they may check the carmens thats how they kill you try to vote them out of the sever
This is the best game ever but problem is that the features that they hadso many now they have limited you cant type worst update but good game
"Dont know what people are saying about the name and chat,  because I had no problems with it. This game is amazing 5 out of 5 stars. Would rate 10 if I could."
"Love it but please change graphics to original,  or add option for player to change graphics to original on their device"
I really do not like what they added as far as all those chat options go. Half the fun was seeing random things being typed
To be honest I really like the old one when there was no updates because now it is extremely hard just to type a letter thats why Im giving this game one star 
Omg the game is so fun but when I am imposter theres a few glitches and lags but it fun I have been playing for a year now and its so popular so I rate this a 5 because its just the best game of 2021
"I cud give it a 5 but the problem is the mach making..it sucks,  it probable takes 5 mins just to get in to get in a game because of that.. So plz innerslothamong us plz fix this... thank you "
The game is awsome but I dont like the the free quick chat please make the chat that we can type whatever we want thats why its a 2 star
Get rid of quick chat and free chat I cant play with my little sister cause she has restrictions on her tablet so I can join her quick chat is alright for little kids but shes older than that you shouldnt have to sign in to play with siblings
The new update sucks Just allow us to type with our own keyboard Its so annoying that I cant find perfect option at perfect time 
Stupid new chat ruined the game I feel like never playing now Take away that stupid new chat and Ill play but until then Im playing something else)
I dont like the account stuff and those kind of things because Its kind of hard for me and it used to be fun until it changed but its still a good game I guess
Fun game now that all bugs have been fixed with more recent updates. No complaints.
"In the first I hated this game but when I realised that you have to take the settings take data and you have to set free chat ,  I only realized when it was told when you sign in"
"Uninstalling,  the chat restrictions are so annoying and I cant make my own username. I heard the only way itll work is to proove ur over 18 and it looks like I have to make an account using my gmail. Just collecting ur personal info basically."
"Used to be a good game but now you need a separate account to play,  even after you make it,  the game still doesnt work"
I loved the game before the update 1. you cant talk and 2. Every code I put in doesnt work so I cant play with my friends
I love this game but the only thing wrong is that the pets are exspensive if u make them less exspensive I will love it.
The worst among us update. It has completely ruined the game. We want old among us back. Atleast remove the quick chat and do it free chat
With this new update I really dont like it because it doesnt let you chat freely like its so stupid.

Im really sorry for my language about the stupid but it is true Im really sorry but I just dont like the update so thats why Im giving it a twostar maybe the the quick chat maybe remove the quick chat so people can type freely and what if people dont have time to anything with the quick chat I know that was an update for like a couple months ago but I really still dont like it. Bye...
Its just Awesome. It has a problem of quick chat but if you sign in you can get rid of that. I love this game
"This uses to be a very fun game,  but ever since quick chat was brought in the game feels very slow and not fun."
Edit Congrats Innersloth You just earned yourself a ONE star rating. Just what the heck do you think your doing I upodated and the crewmates look HIDEOUS. You just completely ruined the game....

Just what the heck do you think your doing I upodated and the crewmates look HIDEOUS. You just completely ruined the game.... Why would you change it I wouldnt even CALL it an improvement for christ sake. I am probably going to quit this game thanks A LOT for ruining it idiots. Getting stuck in place after a meeting is fixed also is NOT fixed liars
Its a nice game with different maps and its fun. By fun i mean fun. And i think it should have more different maps and roles
Very fantastic game but sometimes we cant make our own game  i think internet problem.otherwise its amazing
The game is always laggy.I tried to uninstall it but it never works. Asus Zen Pad 10. Plus when is submerged coming 
Thanks to some guidance from the reviews (Paramon Yevstigneyev) the horrible chat system is no more and oh does it seem so much better Thank you
"Love this game on my phone. Played some on my Chromebook. Chromebook updated and it says the game is installed,  but I will cursed if I know where or how to find the dang thing.... But I love the game otherwise."
"Can you release a new update My phone is back on the latest update and the icon for the game is the same as the old one,  please fix this if you can"
This game is amazing love it but the thing is that I played for 4 days atlest and hour a day and have only been imposter once
Telling this to all adults this this game is very helpful to kids to teach them not to just strangers The game teaches them a lot of important knowledge that helps them in many situations
This game is amazing. But when I was playing as crewmate someone killed me then I immediately got banned in game for Hacking even though Ive never hacked in among us in my life. Please fix this.
Hey this us a good game but there is a bug that makes the vents open and close with out anyone going in so me and my friends said that the lobby was haunted so plz fix this
"When I load in a and game its start Im stuck on a black screen fix this bug now,  And I cant change my name please fix that,  And add us being able to type emojis"
This game is awesome but I think you should add a private chat for imposters like the ghosts have but one only imps can access throughout the game
"Please  Remove the meanless obligation of quickchat. We cant nor create an account neither choose a player name. Allow the keyboards of the languages in host as arabic not alarabiya. You took a long time to fix this ,  I want play ( Thanks for your hard work )"
I sometimes just get disconnected from the saver and i have to wait 9 minutes.
Excellent Game. One bug is that sometimes even when network is strong we get disconnected from the game
Its good and all that but i dont like how you cant say your own words you have to use the games words it would be a 5 but im giving it a 4 please change this or tell me why this HAS to happen.
I like the game but one thing I was playing these guys are pressing the button like 100 every game Im little bit angry about that.......
"Among us has been a great game after this update. I was disappointed before the newer version came out. But,  I am happy to declare that I now satisfy this game for fun and happiness. Have a great day."
I like this game so much . It was very fun we can play with our friends sooooooo awosome and this game has free play and multiplayer too give 5 stars to this game 
"I used to adore this game but there was 1 MASSIVE annoying thing that is making me rate this Downword,  THE SAFE CHAT you cant type your own name either u have to use radom like bro WHAT IF I DONT WANT TO BE CALLED sunnysrobe Or Evilapple I HATE THIS SO MUCH honestly it ruins the creativity of the ...Full ReviewI used to adore this game but there was 1 MASSIVE annoying thing that is making me rate this Downword,  THE SAFE CHAT you cant type your own name either u have to use radom like bro WHAT IF I DONT WANT TO BE CALLED sunnysrobe Or Evilapple I HATE THIS SO MUCH honestly it ruins the creativity of the game,  And the safe Chat in game example If I saw someone kill and self report  try blame me Then u cant even Explain what happened this update sucks so much I honestly hate itI wont recommend"
I like the game the updates are truly amazing But whenever I wanna play on my chromebook the mouse sometimes dosent show maybe might be my chromebook or the game.
Very fun and editing and able as many strategy in among us as Imposter so it it is brain teasing for the strategy to appear its a good game
Fun game but it lags everytime when I become imposter and it makes it hard to play.
Love it It keeps disconnecting and not allowing me to play peacefully which is amazing
I need old among us back....chat section is junk now it is so hard to talk...the old graphics were better.
I used to love it but the chatting sucks now I mean its limited and it takes me forever to say want I want and it sucks it got a lot funner with the airship but the chat just ruins it all
on my phone it works fine but l am on pc so l installed it but it says l have to buy it on steam and on steam it costs 49 dollars l think they should put a free pc version
I loved this game cuz it lets us type but now it doesnt. It always lags and say disconnected so Imma give it 2 stars. I loved this game so 3 stars it enough
when i set the game on private so my brother could join it didnt work please fix this and when you do youll get a 5 star until then.
"Great game. Would recommend playing this if we go into another quarantine,  especially since they added the clean vent task."
"I really love ur game,  there are no ads on this game I love this game its my all time fav game ,  thankyou for making this game . and I love this game bye and thankyou very very much .  I will like to see ur another game like this too . Keep it up "
I have perfect wi fi but the game never leads in. When it does the loading screen to get in a game freezes. Need to go back to the old among us
"I wish innersloth would just delete quick chat and random name chooser, I want free chat and free names, I still like the character design and colors ) ("
Half of the screen was black and the new chat update it doesnt even let us chat please fix it. And I deleted it but I installed it back.
"I used to love this game but after the update,  i wasnt even able to type what i want or the name i want,  i like the old among us better if it still doesnt come back im Deleting it all."
I like this game a lot I havent played the new update yet only cause my game refuses to let me play online it just stays on the loading forever and I dont know how to fix it if someone knows pls tell me
So like it is glichy it needs your email why does it need your email you you cant put in your own name i was seeing what the randomiz thing so I taped it and I changed my name but I wanted to put back my original name but I di not let me i would put 0 stars if I could. Srry bad grammar.
Ok this app is so fun but...... Quick chat is still bad BUTT the guest thingy made a bit better so 4 stars
"It was fun before the new update, I love the new colors but I want to make my name and I want to text on the chat all of my siblings hate the new update except for the new colors  Im pretty sure almost everybody hates the new update."
The additional asset is taking forever to download. miss the older version of this game
It is amazing but i cant sign it always says something when wrong please try agian later. So yeah fix it
"innersloth,  I loved this game bit the quick chat is so annoying and I cant even change my name I loved the old one.

Make it a successful game once again and a request I want is a green pastel color and maybe blue please. Thank you once again."
Use to be good was good but they took out free chatting and custom names like jeez just add new stuff and the map and keep the old stuff
WOW FIRST I LOVED THIS THEN THE TRASH UPDATE CAME I LOVED THIS BOOM WE HAVE TO USE FAST CHAT LIKE IT MAKES NO SENSE AND FIX YOUR GAME I CANT EVEN PLAY CAUSE IT TAKES SO LONG EVEN A HOUR LONG DOESNT EVEN OPEN PUBLIC WHEN I HOST ONE IT JUST SITS THERE BLACK I LOVED IT NOW I GIVE IT A 3 STARS
Lol if you have problem with unable to type chat I have a solution go to settings while you are playing in a public server then go to settings press thr sensor chat option to get the ability to chat check my channel Aiden Shanil to see how to do it I will post it as soon as I can.
Among us is now really boring and if u have played the first version. U can now only select chat n the animations now are boring
"For some reason,  Amung Us isnt working on my Samsung A52. Failer after 9 response. I can only play on wifi."
Its a great game. but I know you have save chat but if I want to say something I cant say it because its not on Save chat
"I have been playing this since I got this phone but now the game has rp and weebs that want rp and if I try joining theyll ban me so fix that or make it a report option because this is unneeded and runs the game entirely (also make more good games man,  but make them fun like this)"
"I miss the old among us,  everything was so simple. now theres no time to talk,  do tasks,  and theres so many rude bullies and horny kids with single girl single boy as a username.

Bro next update add emoji please because chating is gone very intrested and launch free skins then please correct each map room each column because when we search a map that map will be not found .bytheeay best game
Bring back the custom chat as current ui makes the playing a lot difficult. Hoping for update soon
"Hmm after the update it is not working properly and always no room,  when creating own room it says there are more rooms like whut Please fix this."
The games decent but I hate how it wont let me type if you make it so you can type on your own again Id love the game
Its good but j want there to be a friends menu because when u get into a good lobby you want to see them again so adding a friends list would be good
I dont like how you cant type anything how the old version is 10 times better please fix it back to how it was before
The og among us was better now I can barely figure out how to talk plus theres no auto start so if the host doesnt start you either have to wait or join a new server they made among us a bad game they need to go back
I love this game I play this game everyday Oh and also I kind of wish theres like a gaming list like all your friends is on them and that you can invite them I think thatd be cool you please guys do them
I really like this game me and my friends play it all the time but I dont really like that we cant just type what we want to say its difficult to say what we want to
chatting system is very irritating and make this game boring. Please bring back chat system only .
I dont like this game anymore as Edit now thanks to among us to add it again as now if we sign up u can use the chat again and please add more roles in among us to make it more popular
Its a good game but the new update is kinda not good i guess I cant really kick a player whos being rude or a hacker out of my server it says they left after playing for one round but they are still in the game
i give it 4 stars because not much bugs but still needs a little adujustments but its areally fun game toplay with family and friends the map is really cool
This game is the worst online game we can not chat to explain about imposters and when u r opening the it will take time for that small boy to run and when u go to online and press public it will say u disconnected from the server I hate this even Roblox is better than this game
"It wont let me play anything anymore. I cant find any games,  start any games or join a game by entering a code."
This game is awesome but Ive been waiting all day for the submerged map and it still does not give me the option to update it
I love this game but I cant update it I want to play the submerged map can you fix this issue
Its a good game but after I update it the second time it keeps telling me to do a download but I dont want to it takes up my space. And I cant do free play anymore
Love it but there is one wrong thing with the update because my sister says that now you have to tap some sentence just to say something and she does not like that so can you just please fix that and let her type please
Super Cool and fun and also should come out with a 2nd one as well where you can play mods and up to 29 players my be new maps ethier way this is the best game Ive ever downloaded 
the new update was bad i love this game but not now for this new update please fix this and when i want to play with my brother the chat problem and than first we want to quit chat and than we can play together please fix this bye
"Honestly,  the 5 minute wait after disconnect needs to go. It serves no purpose but to piss us off"
Love it. It has teamwork (as in only crewmates) I am updating great game but there are still glitches just fix those
"Would be a 5 but the new chat restrictions really takes away from the game. Can I get why Yes. However,  I just think a few bad apples shouldnt change the game."
A pretty alright game. Its fun with friends but with public lobbies it can be pretty annoying.
I love how you can free chat again and the new mapsThanks so much for fixing that 
Worlds one of the most famous game played by almost every youtuber. And also I like it. wish it was free for Pc as well.
"Good Game,  but there are more bugs and i thing if they concentrate on bugs it will be a superb game..."
This is a great game and all but I dont understand why ghost should be in meetings they can even do anything and they cant free chat anymore so can you maybe change that
At first it was brilliant game for free chat and change name but its not possible now.. my guardians always says yes to all my games.fix it
I love the new uptade and everything but the reason I gave it 4 stars is because I cant type directly so please do a new update so that we can type properly.
Too many disconnects. Bugs galore UPDATE 972021 STILL TOO MANY DISCONNECTS
I just love this game it is the best game I have played it is my favorite game the characters are so cute and the graphics are really nice the tasks are also nice just love it
Ok Im done it wont work every time I play the game wont download the files and every time I play it shows a black screen eventhough the game is playing while the screen is dark
Ever since the new update about the quick chat and random name the game has been getting really annoying. Like why couldnt Inersloth realease the airship without any of these things and i hope that nothing even worse happens when the submerged map comes.
"I cant play anymore because it take forever to try and find public games,  i was waiting for five minutes and it was still loading"
"Youd think for a game already desperately trying to cling onto relevancy,  they wouldnt have changed the perfectly fine chat system they had until now."
Among us is great but the update made it harder 2talk to your friends and its so anoyying that you need a lot of info to get a name am only giving it one star
I love this game Among us was the best game ever and I got one problem with this game and the perple are not telling it was petty sus and I dont why perple dont know how to play this game but I like it so I put 5 and then I like the new map you made so I love it
Great game they have made the mechanics in the games much better i love the new map and its much more enjoyable i highly reccomend it
"Not working,  keeps saying reliable packets when I try to join a game and nothing is wrong with my internet"
You cant even chat at all I used to love this game but since the new update its really hard to play
Cant load in to a game. When I try and create a game I get a black screen forever so now I cant play the game.
"Would love to play again but chat system is not good,  takes more time and you cant feel the expressions from words when someone is being accused for"
"I love this game it is so satisfying when we become imp  kill the crewmates ,  but something I dont appreciate is can we pls remove the quick chat it is so borring I dont wanna sign in so it is so boring with the quick chat"
I used to like this game but an update came out and I wasnt able to speak in the chat and you have to sign in to play
Im only giving it two stars because I couldnt play online when I installed it on the Amazon appstore but everything else is still good.
I love the game but Im giving it 4 star because it says free chat not av available so I put in guardians email it says wrong email... And I say this is the write email
The new update is awesome and also to talk you have to go on the home screen hit hit settings and then hit General then you can talk
It is very slow on Lenovo tablets and when it loads in the game it sends you back to the play store so do not get among us on Lenovo tablets
Was a 4 star but since you cant type what you want in chat anymore the game sucks and I can see alot of other people think that too
"I dont agree with all the memes for this game. With minimum developers and a creative idea,  this game is pretty incredible I also like how much the game is updated."
For those people who cant chat freely just sign in the account so that you can chat freely.The develepor must clearify the confusion for the gamer.
This game was so good and perfect but when the chat update came out it just ruined the gsme for me.

I didnt know how to say anything and it was so slow and limited so when im the imposter I cant defend myself in meetings Can you please make the chat normal I khow people swear and all but the game was so much more fun with normal chat Or you can make it optional for servers
Please fix the name and the chat only those two parts the airship map you can keep but the name and hat must be fixed but still a fun game.
"It would be sick if you make a new app called Among Us alpha with the older versions,  before the airship and chat update. That be nice but still nice game with bugs."
I am so tried of trying to get on this game when i am trying to play with friend it say that you chat mode is incorrect but before it used to be a fun game so yeah
Its like to be a killer or a fixer of the ship killers crush your targets fixers fix rhe ship cool game so fun
Forget what I said about this being a good game the fast chat isnt fast its way slower also it harder to tell crewmates what you saw also the sigh in doesnt work
This nice game but there problem. First You have to choose what You want say pls add the old chat or i delete this
Very laggy and typing is bad because hard to say your innocent or who is imposter. Other than that pretty ok game.
This is very fun with all the updates and you get some good deals when you buy stuff from the shop
Before the new update everything was good and because the chat is gone now games not so good and you cant even pick your username they should put the old update back
It was a very great game but because of custom name and the message type it is now very hard to play pls fix it
I really love amung us when it began to get popular I was playing it 247 and then all the games started glitchen and I always had 2 logout 45 ]
"I like the new update although I think we should be able to free chat. Apart from that,  I give it four stars. "
Its fun but honestly the new chat filter makes it almost to impossible to even talk and I take lime 2 minute just to say some information its not that fun no more
This game is so good. But for me ill give it a 4 star beacuse u cant reply something u want to say in the chats like.. Its so unfair.
"Ever since the new update the game never works for me anymore,  would love that to be fixed,  thank you."
It used to be very good in the past but now its a little worse than the past because that in the past you could say whatever you wanted but now it chat is ruined from the new update i really hope you would listen to me but im sure you wont at all because im just one of your players
I love this game but if you ban all the hackers and fix all the issues it will be a good game
After the update they gave quick chat and normal chat this game is cool but It has some bugs and also please add the option to add friends
"Constantly get disconnected,  randomly banned for literally just joining a room. Games lost most if its fun."
This was a good game but the developers made some unwanted updates and ruined the game. Cant even type in chat such a disappointment
pretty good not glitchy but I just wish there was some default pets you dont have to pay for same with the skins
I love this game  but only of chat problem and we cant even write oour name plz fix this and my bff is wanted to play with me but it says the server has not found please  make it ok fix this I cant play with my bff  What do you think
It doesnt let me put my account for free chat and I cant type anything in game whith quick chat I would have gave it 5 stars
I will give you five stars when u remove that emergency meeting option. When i am impostor i cannot kill anyone. They call the emergency meeting and eliminate someone and this keeps going on every game. Please remove emergency meeting option.
"When i signed in there is still the mini crewmates spinning and I cant do anything its doing it over and over again,  thats it Ill buy the game instead"
"No point in any stars if i cant even get into a lobby  (Oh but i do like some of the new graphics,  i just cant play...)"
This Is A Game Or What. Its Like A Dream To Become A Imposter Or Crewmate. Its A Nice Game. This Should Be At 1st Positio. I Like This Game Very Much.
I play on PC it takes money but I use hack and anyon can also play on bluestacks if want to play in PC without money and dont waste money on game ..... This is best game ..... I like fortnite toooooooooooo........
"I do love the old version but,  the new version where you cant type isnt as great."
Yeah I love this game so much I cant even stop playing but I want the submerged map so you release submerged map same time when Road map release. THANKS 
This game is pretty fun but I cant do the text chat. EDIT Fixed the bugfeature. Back to a five 
I would give it 5 stars as its brilliant but when I put my email in to use free chat and other things it wont work
I really love this app before I didnt know much with the new update and now I know is fun me and my sis play online together we can play public amazing and private 
WHY DOESNT THE APP INSTALL WITH MY PHONE ISEND A FEEDBACK BUT NO ONE RESPONDED... fix this because i had AMONGUS on my phone but that airship update made it dissaper so FIX DIS
I love this but theres one thing people on other devices can play modes but on others you cant Id hope to see some mods in the future

I really miss the old among us. It used to be so fun and now its just ruined. I wish you would fix it
"Now,  yes I absolutely LOVE Among Us,  but what the freaking heck happened to THE CHAT We have to SIGN IN JUST TO WRITE FREELY OH AND I AM GOING TO SAY THIS CALMLY,  Please.Fix.The.Bugs. thank you,  ah... I should have gave this a one star..."
Was a good game before but I uninstalled it after all the changes and it is way harder to speak in chat.
It was good a few versions ago but you you made the game unplayable with that terrible chat feature. It no longer sparks joy.
The game itself is pretty good the major problem is the chat I would rather be sworn at then not being able to speak freely
I am starting to hate this game before it was fine now after the update it has body report glitch and the most hated thing is that I have been playing since like 3 months for 1 months i got impostor for 1 time a day and I used to get Happy but now 2 months and 0 impostor fix it 
Not bad.but all player has plan all thing to kill imposter and when they become imposter they tell each other they all cheat.it deserve 3 stars.
Thank you for fixing the problem that i had mentioned before. Now I can fully enjoy this game again. My most favorite part of this game is being the impostor and getting out other impostors as a crewmate
In among us you can play with your friends with 5 to10 players if you are a crewmate you have to do takse to win but if you are a inposter you get too kill your friends you can also sabotage and close doors to trape your friends theres also a new map you can play
I dunno what happend to this game...but I used play this game like for hours...but since the new update I couldnt even play in public...Even I m unable to create a lobby...pls fix this bcz it deserves 5 ratings
The reason Im giving it 3  is because 1.u cant type whatever you want in the chat 2. u cant choose whatever name u want but I like the new skin colors
Good game blah blah blah but theres a glich where when a game starts it wont load it will just be pitch black and i can hear chat but i cant see
Before updating app is nice after updating there are some technical issues I am unable to chat and half screen is in black background better you guys fix it
"Why cant i chat what i want to say please update the game that we could chat what we want to say its not easy chat at the game anymore,  you need to find what to say and i cant even do the easy way"
Its a good app and very interesting but if u add voice chat it would be much more interesting so please add voice chat .
Well I liked the original better the chat now you cant type what you want and it makes it boring to play now
I have great wifi service and everytime Im in a middle of a game it kicks me out Fix this
Not working. The game was working fine before but now all we get is a black screen when we go to start the game.
"This is a great app but when the update come, quick chat was released and free chat was no longer used.So please get it back"
I really hate the new update. I use to love this game. But I wish we could text nad or say what we wanted its so hard. Its just stupid. Among us has a rating of 3.6 Among us makers if you want higher ratings pls just fix my complaint.
This is a decent game though but i dont play it anymore its just the same thing imposter crewmate over and over again
Among us is a great game but the chat sucks Im giving it 4 stars because of the new colors but bring back the old chat
"Good game,  pls bring the old chat and i want more tasks like set up table in the meeting room. We want the name to be made by us,  not random,  pls return free chat,  love the game"
I like this game but you have to sign in and i did not like that part it is not long i LOVE THE colors
I like it but when the new map comes out Pls fix and make it better. But nice game tho.
Typing option please so if I am Imposter I make story and by colour is good if time is less you can find fast in voting time but in name it take very much time
Fun game but there is so much bugs in this game it not even funny how much bus that in the game try to play it on others platforms but it still fun
"Please put the update back to normal I cant chat when i have something important to say its hard to tap alllll of the stuff typing is sooooo much easier and our names are are confusing cause when my friends join i dont know who they are And i miss my name  please put it back to normal charlott...Full ReviewPlease put the update back to normal I cant chat when i have something important to say its hard to tap alllll of the stuff typing is sooooo much easier and our names are are confusing cause when my friends join i dont know who they are And i miss my name  please put it back to normal charlotte,  age,  9"
"Dis game is totally 100 amazing game online but the reasons i rated into 3 star First,  i hate that cant changing name Sec,  i hate this game started have damn account Before activate level is better  plz remove that own acc plz "
I do not like the way the names are made I wish you could just type it in again and it isnt random and the account system is dumb too.
"Very good with vent update,  but innersloth would it be possible to add voice chatproximity chat please. Typing gets very annoying and is quite slow"
"I loved among us well I did but when I was able to say whatever the new update stopped that and it sucked.So I rate 3 stars, maybe if the talking didnt stop I would of rated 5."
This is the best game good but add a new update like this add 100 players and it should be like in the game only we can add more mods plss
This game is good but the chat does not work I try to change it into free chat but it says quick chat only
"I would have given 4 stars but you should make some changes like you should allow us free chat.pls,  it would be awesome if you will."
My internet can handle PUBG I can play it in stable ms (ping) But My internet cant handle this game This game sucks Fix this game It needs alotta work
Among us is a good game except the new updates have just recked it.Like for example you cant say what you want to say and you have to use their system to speak.And also you cant make up a name you have to use the randiomizer
Thanks innersloth. I love the new map. But I really liked the old name thing and the chat one. I give 5 stars now. )
its a very good online game for me . im playing this game for a long time but tge old one of this game was better idk why but its still very good
Just why thay change the chat its just dryand its boing tho but Ill like the old one cus the chat so we can say stuff but now it change  and I dont know why  but I use to like the old maps and why did that added the Henry one is just a bit fun but a bit dry and I missed the old o...Full ReviewJust why thay change the chat its just dryand its boing tho but Ill like the old one cus the chat so we can say stuff but now it change  and I dont know why  but I use to like the old maps and why did that added the Henry one is just a bit fun but a bit dry and I missed the old one pls bring the old one back
App refuses to open even though I have updated it. Keeps saying Among us has unfortunately stopped and its really annoying.
This game was amazing until the update. In the new update auto chat is trash. The chat should be optional.. Auto chat ruined the game
It was a fun game but the update took away all my favorite things including roleplaying name choosing and chatting freely
"this was a fun game before the update it kinda is hard to play when you can, t actually type and the hole knew update is glitchy i like the old version better"
"I really like this game,  but the fact that quick chat was added makes me kinda sad because I cant tell people what Im really trying to tell them."
"Great game Its simple and easy to learn,  games are quick and fun."
I loved this game.. It was a very nice game but eversince the new update came i did not get to be the Imposter not even 1 time. I am not joking. u have to work on this
"Super awesome,  i get to play with friends,  it is simple but fun,  perfect game overall."
Being the impostor is way more fun than teammate. Running around killing and sabotaging is all around fun.
This is a nice game but there are problems and main thing there are lot of hackers how
"the game bacame so complicated you cant chat on your own,  I kinda miss the old among us but the new update is still good its just the chat update"
"Hey everybody the sign in was simple all of u need to have Google play account and then press sign in with account to get free chat and other things (android, iOS, apple, iphone).sorry devs cuz I made the rating into 1 I just need to help kids 12 and above dont worry just read my other account to help...Full ReviewHey everybody the sign in was simple all of u need to have Google play account and then press sign in with account to get free chat and other things (android, iOS, apple, iphone).sorry devs cuz I made the rating into 1 I just need to help kids 12 and above dont worry just read my other account to help u I rated It 5 star ok be happy innersloth"
I think a feature that would make this app even better is of it had the option to send requests to other players and can talk even if it not ona lobby
"Every time I join a lobby the game crashes instantly,  even when Im in Freeplay."
Awesome game but you definitely have to have a extremely good wifi connection or it will time out
Before this its a good game...now after a lot of update...Its a complete rubbish and a pile of cowdung from a farm...The app dev just screwed up the game with bunch of useless trash updates making it the worst game to be played....Do anyone knows how to rate negative stars
So this game is the best game I have ever tried but I dont really like the new updait for the game and  was mad that I cant type and it gives me type options witch I getting so stressed about also I think u can type free if u play th is game on computer
"This update sucks,  Is was amazing but this update ruined it,  with the new chat update,  and it disconnects,  AMONG US SUCKS NOW"
"A M O G U S. In all seriousness,  this is just a simple murder mystery game. Once it gets more roles,  this would definitely be much better."
Game is is good but we can not chat that we want and it was not better than old version in old version we can chat as we want plz fix this then I will give you 5 stars plz fix the problem otherwise I will delete this game
"THIS GAME IS VERY GOOD guys if you cant change your name pls sign in Google play games,  you can change your name if you sign in,  also if you cant type change it to free or quick chat you can write a message if you switch it on free or quick chat (at data settings) this the answer of your problems...Full ReviewTHIS GAME IS VERY GOOD guys if you cant change your name pls sign in Google play games,  you can change your name if you sign in,  also if you cant type change it to free or quick chat you can write a message if you switch it on free or quick chat (at data settings) this the answer of your problems."
I love this game but can you please fix the chat back to the way it use to be I would give it 5 stars if you fixes it
This is a very good game but yesterday I tried playing but it kept loading and i waited for 30minutes but still didnt load plz fix this
"Ok the game is like ok but the update... Just no.... Like no.... Its actually sucks because siblings,  friends,  buddies,  neighbors,  cant play among us together what a dumb chat update but the game is still pretty fun. And yeah"
"I always used to love this game but now it is horrible we can, t write what we want its changed please let the game be like it used to be please"
Can you like change the fact that most if it full or started lobby show full or already started so people dont go back to the front screen
Nice game so fun but some problems only login with Google Play we can change the name please change all can change the name without login in Google Play... Thank you
honestly its good but they changed the chat so it takes a long time too type...other wise its good added new task and new clours so really good
"I loved this game,  one of my fav games but after the chat update its so hard to play and I quit it,  pls bring free chat again"
The game is nearly perfect but pls change the chat back to how it used to be its alot harder to talk now yes I am talking about the auto chat
Its a fun game but you have to update it lots and its a bit frustrating
"Hmmmm,  good game but in practice mode can U please make the AI move and randomly generated names to make it realistic "
I gave it 1 star cuz of new update(srry for my bad English ) now i didnt like because 1.I cant chat properly. 2.I cant put the name I want. 3.Please fix the update if possible...
I love the killer vibe Like kill or be killed I would give 5 stars but you can just get free wins with other devices in one lobby
"Good game But a lot of hackers please fix this,  i cant even play because of them ."
Among us helps me to practice to blend in with the others. The game is very relaxing.
"I loved Among Us before the new update, you cant chat without Guardian supervision what has this game become over the years"
Okay lets start with the basics. 1 Chat Features it sucks. 2. Pets hats and outfits cost alot 3. This game doesnt allow some names 4. Airship sucks
The game is like Roblox you can play with random people online its really fun however people like to say bad words even if you havent done anything to them so I think its a cruel thing to do but other than that this is a really good game
I like this game soo much It is very interesting I will very fear when the imposter killed me I will always wait for the imposter....
"This game sucks after the update,  aka downgrade. The chat is ruined and the emergency meeting looks weird. Even the oxygen code font is worse no wonder nobody plays this any more"
Please in next 2022 put new task please I love this game at first I thought this game is normal game and my friend told his fav game it was among us and I kinda listen some where and then I remember I play this game
Wow its my favourite game. U know I used to have fear of violence but after playing this game Im not scared at all. Good work innersloth keep it up..
Nice but it must have some update of tasks and have a one free pet so tha we can play for mre time so that i will rate this app 5 star
Chatting system is worst ...it was very fine in earlier version but in new one its hard to communicate for the simple thing
I like it but its stupid with that dum wheel to talk and u can only use 1 word and they should remove the email thing to change ur name and talk proply
It used to be fun but now its boring the chat filter is hard and confusing to use
The game is good but we shouldnt wait extra minutes for disconnecting because we dont do it intentionally all the time
Nice changes but exceft for the chat box there are so many bonds because the the chat box please and also the name
Whenever you added choose what you say it just kind of ruined. I liked whenever you didnt have to sign up im sorry but the game is ruined.
It is really fun to play but the problem is that the full server kicks me out and that annoys me
I just want to say 1 thing. They want me to login but I need to fix the login it said everytime I login it said error What That y I giv 4stars

"I love this game. I didnt like the update that one time in April or something,  but I gave the game another try and I love it"
Why did you add quick chat The game was fine before that. Just plz remove the account system and quick chat plz and let us type our own user names. But its still a great game
Game is broken can not play so much lag game auto ends this is terrible used to be amazing if I could I would rate 0 star
"I think the game in general is good,  but you cant type in chat. I think that is quite annoying"
I love this game I my favorite map is the airship I even got costumes to sport the ones that made among us and. By the way thanks for fixing so many bugs
i used to love this game so much. But now i get disconnected every match and the chat ruined everything.
So I was just playing among us with some friends and then servers are no longer available pop up and Im confused so I cant join or create a game of among us plz fix this issue
"The game is perfect now I can chat, play without glitch or disconnection n,  also Im looking forward to the new SUBMERGED MAP If its gonna come"
The game wasnt very popular back then in 2016 but now when it got popular everything has gotten worse I wish the old amongus was still around also you cant type anymore
The game was great before the quick chat update. That one sucks. Dont dowload but it could.d be fun if you get ur account set up
"This game was fun but now it sucks because it wont let me do chat,  this must be fixed"
This game is so good but please add a new map like...any cool map I mean a bigger map and please fix the tasks bug when there arent any tasks

This game is bad now I think they had a updated but know I can not pick a name and I have to wait 35min to play with someone and this takes a lot space one star dont like it at all
This game used to be fun but its not now you need to sign in and also the auto chat is the worst pls change this game back to normal
Idk what these 1 stare reviews are saying but they are wrong if there older than 12 then they should be able to text in chat just fine but if they are under 12 then there is no reason for it
It was nice but now its not nice... The chat system is the worst.. ugh Fix it fast.
This is a great game I like your company the drawers for the walk and idle animation
Love it Its soo fun and they updated it so much. It is kinda boring if u play alone online but if u play with friends its very fun
"Among us is ok,  but with the 15 player lobby,  now its harder to get imposter. Plus,  when is the submerged map coming"
"I used to love this game,  played all the time Now with all the updates its really annoying to play. Not fun anymore....."
Do I even need to explain how good this game is Just get it. Its free. Back to 5 stars as of 7721. The game now opens properly. Thanks for fixing D

I love this game The only problem is that it keeps saying disconnected from 6 pings
Why did you guys change everything It was perfect just the way it was the new maps are great but the chat sucks. Please change the chat back to the way it was.
But u need to have an opinion to send friend request so if we make friends then we can play and talk to them every time we play I think that would be a great addition to the game
Update with auto chat completely ruined the game for me and almost everyone else who played before the new autochat feature.
"Only problem rn are the hackers please fix them Edit Sigh,  I miss the old days. My rating 5 now its 2. The amount of things that made me change my decision should be pretty clear and kinda same as other players concerns."
It was great to the update I played it everyday all day with my family I hate the new update I love all the colors but the rest no if the colors for the only update part then I would love it hope I helped you decide if you want this game

i love to download this game since 2020.i love the the update.but i cant chat anymore.your new chat is i cant find a name of impostors because the time is running up.
used to be a great game before it was popular but than it just kept getting worse and worse and now you cant even type anymoreand is verry hard to comunicate and disgus things and people pretty much just guess with no stratagey
"Good game but chating system is worst. When we have type what we want, I love that stratergy."
Best game but being the impostor is much fun the reason I gave it 4 stars is because.... you already know it... hackers they hack you cant have peace please make update with not hackers
the game is fun but a glitch has prevented us from being abl to play and the new writing method is useless
"If it was 2019 i could say that it is the best game ever but with such errors and updates, I just can say it is sth like another games in this topic."
Best Game ed ever I love when your the impostor Its so fun put pc is a little hard please change the controls for pc version love the game 5star

This is such a good game I play it every day its so good only I cant use the chat as a guest I hate that so pls fix that I want to chat I dont know how to sign in
Please add friend request option to make friends in game its very disappointed please I request you.overall game is amazing need friend request option.
Okay inersloth pls fix this i have been playing among us for 3years now and you updated the game on no chat and no username.I tryed to go to parent portal and it keeps saying message blockedfor no reason pls fix this
Its fun because you get to communicate with and work together and being imposter is fun trying not to get caught killing someone
"I love the new map and task I just love it so much P.S please add more new features and map and tasks because u only added one task and map,  and I was thinking of you adding the prison map from Henry stickman so plz add that map"
the game is so bad i cant give evidence that someone is imposter or to chat with other people to reach a result and voting someone not just telling vote someone without giving evidence or a conversation before
Yeah I was signed in but now it wont let me it takes forever please help me with this and I cant go to your stupid email thing like everyone always said neither great game but it takes to long to sign in.
"One of the best online game,  can build our concentration power and helps us to stay alert."
There is one problem sometimes when I report a dead body its infinite dead bodys with every color and pls fix this thanks D
This game so far is amazing just to many updates such as the chat update I dont not for 1 like the chatting update and I really just missed the old among us.
In all games I play I like this game the most because I love the maps in this game among us you should add a custom colour or pet option
The game is fun but there is an issue when we download the game and open it the download is not happening

I used to love this game the chat really messed it up and I have to look through the chat to find the word thats close to see what I want to spell please please PLEASE fix this
Too much frequencies of the disconnection. I just gave up playing the game because of it.
"So many bugs,  we start one crewmember is dead then we are all defeated and it continues to crash and also kills all crewmembers man."
The update seems useless from where you cant type your own response maybe its just me but personally it wont let me type my own response.
Very fun game with very good graphics  the bew update is trash and the game has died i rote the old review when the game was actually good I Uninstalled it 
"Please add back the Filipino(Tagalog) and other languages chat back for the sake of your fans. Also,  can you add add friends or friend requests That would be cool and I would change this 3 stars into 4 stars if you made it happen.."
The change of the sign in page really pisses. Me off.its just complete stupidity to make me put my email. Its just plain retarded
Last time i said it need a new map I like the map but now the chat box is the problem from that New update I stop playing so fixe it pls thx
"Finally i can start playing this game again,  but i gave it 4 stars because of the new graphics i just hate that they removed the blood from the kills"
Theres a bug where the game loads when theres no internet but I cant join a game because I need internet so please fix this
I would give it 5 stars if it had the old chat the new one sucks and its hard to talk please change it back
Amount us used to be great but with the update my friends have stopped playing it you cant chat freely if your guest it chooses a name for you its getting annoying plz change it Im might delete it Im thinking about it SO PLZ FIX THIS .
Nice game but the hackers are a big issue you should make if commands so that the things whick can a hcker can only do and are done that person geta banned
This game used to be nice.but we cannot chat and Give our own names and sometimes after a few seconds it comes victory.please fix this

Grate game man great game.
Kinda good but I cannot type a word in there it only wants me to put in words in there by selecting words but is still awsome
This game extremely super.i love tasks and the impostor role . In Impostor role I like killing.
It is an awsome game the only thing I dont like is private games it doesnt let you join your friends private server sometimes
The game was the best to play but now you cant even find one decent game without hackers pleasece fix it it is very annoying and not fairbto other players
I was like Madison Winters because the update was ..... not great . Innersloth told me to try their game again and I did . Its not awesome but its alright. I notice lots of people are annoyed about the new update . Im starting to play again
"this app is amazing but the fast chat thing sucks it is so hard to use and u get voted off easy also u cant say what u wanna say u have to say what is on there or you cant say anything else,  if you take it out you would have better ratings,  so pls take it out,  you guys have censored chat for a rea...Full Reviewthis app is amazing but the fast chat thing sucks it is so hard to use and u get voted off easy also u cant say what u wanna say u have to say what is on there or you cant say anything else,  if you take it out you would have better ratings,  so pls take it out,  you guys have censored chat for a reason. so take it out or you will lose money,  people and ratings. But If you do take it out you will gain all that stuff cause everyone really likes the game except for the chat thing you guys added."
Its new updates are absolutely the worst I give it a 1star rated I really hope enter flossing get rid of the updates and let people talk to each other get rid of every bad update except for the Airship thats a really good
I love it but when I want to go to play its loading right but it kicks me out everytime I can play it on phone but why it doesnt work on ipad I dont like it plz how do I make it work plz read this have a great day 
Oh ok you guys actually fixed everything the only problem is the players who are literally children but other than that its the game that I used to love again
I love it but when it updated it and you cant chat whatever you want but still I love it bc if you go to settings you can change it so I love it
The game has a lot of problems starting from connection and features
It wouldnt let my moms email go through so I was stuck playing as guests the whole time and you cant even type as guest But other than that its a pretty good game
its a good game but at some points if can lag off or stuff like that but thT my problem so great game
Its good but the new chat is horrible we cant even write our selves so I liked it before its horrible now I cant even typ so I still play it love the new map but I hate the chat Bye Ok
One of my favorite games but the broke the chat and you cant even actually communicate anymore Is takes all the fun of our the game. It takes an hour to try to say anything.
"app is good... but need a lot of improvements.. like adapt to network changes,  make tasks useful to game scenario etc."
"For me the game wont let me sign in. When I do,  the game doesnt let me press anything,  so I cant play."
Stupid game suddenly disconnect from the match without any error.As i love this game but for this issue i will say stupid.
Please fix server issues and your glitches too. Mainly random imposter is not at all good everyone should be a imposter but here the person who got imposter before getting again and again try fix this error.
A.o.k This app is great. Maybe they can add five nights at Freddys map on for players around the world.
"The game is ok exept the chat,  the account thing,  the data download and the freezing after a body is reported. Fix your game now before google playstore decides to remove among us."
Was a great game before but now its just annoying and the game never works properly. And the chat in game is beyond a joke.
"I really like this game,  but if you upgrade this game,  there are a lot of taboos,  so chat is useless,  ish .. I miss Among Us then"
This game is cool u can kill peps and do tasks but there r no mini games so add them I will give it a 5 star just for now
"I  this game,  but,  id loved if the pets were free,  please,  in the next update,  put the pets for free,  pls (If u can)"
I logged in. and i still cant use free chat. i downloaded the latest version and still cant among us was better before.
"The game would be good if it would actually let me sign in,  I have been trying for an hour and everyone else is playing it around me and I cant join. Does anyone else have this problem"
the task unlock safe task in the ship map is broken you cant switch it at all I hope you will fix it.It is a good game.
"Since the July update,  Id give this game 5 stars. Still addicted to this game,  nothing beats playing among us on discord with your friends We play 5  10 hour sessions on the regular. No other game like it )"
I have one problem with this game I want to sign but its not coming I confirm the email but its not coming pls fix that bug or anything
The game song about killing but its fun you get to create your own person when youre the imposters .
Worst update ever. Takes me soo long to type and the acc stuff just no. Dosent let me play at All. Please remove the update that would properly be a better choice
Eeeeh I dunno why peoples are hating this game.Its actually perfect.Game desing sound effects are just fine ya knowI been playing among us these years.I will support innerslot no matter what.
I give to a one star because when I join a round my screen just goes black and I wait and nothing It doesnt show like a role its just pure black fix this
Because of its graphic and area looking also of runningwalking and also I like previous update version
Its a good game but if you could make it so that we can type our own messeages instead of using pre made ones I would give this game a 5 star
It WAS fun now I just think to myself what if my favorite youtuber joins what will I say. I hate the quick chat get rid of it please now we cant even say why during an emergency meeting. All we ask is that you change the chat.
The idea of the game is very nice and innovative  this game but after the update you cant text what u want to. This causes difficulties to express our opinions and accusations. Plz change the chat to the old type itself  wil give it 5  s
I would have gave it 5 stars but the problem is whenever I go to join games it says network connection problem and my net is 5g fix it asap
"Hello all So after that hiccup with the update,  first,  I am pleased to say we have free speeche,  but only with an account along with changing our names and speed. Second,  15 people can play now Lastly they added more colors ) I am once again satisfied"
I try and get onto the game and it kicks me off after taking forever to load
"Hi.. Yah um. I played this game today just bc,  I wanted 2 see what changed. I dont like the chat thing its irritates me so much that I cant type 4 myself. Thx bye"
Like I loved this game until the new update quick chat like I CANT disable it it just wont let me thats why I put 3 stars
there is a bug that when two cremates press the lader at the same time one crewmate is saved an the other one is stuck there going up and down untill the game ends if the game ends
"I really like this game but the thing that I hate is the quick chat,  it ruined the whole game,  its so hard to discuss who you think is the imposteror clear someone "

I have spent around 10 on the account created on my phone and I never use my phone to play since I find it easier on pc. I would like to be able to use the account I have spent my money on. I honestly think I might uninstall this game after this.
It is a really good game but the thing is with the chat it was better without the out the the those thing or whatever
this is a pretty good game] Ill increase the Stars if you get rid of quick chat pleaseeeeee Im so desperate[ I just cant bear quick chat I hope you get rid of it] Baiii3
I dont like how it closes down after like 10 mintues of being in the lobby if you change it to not do that or make it like 30 mintues its 4 stars
"Fun Murder Mystery game,  I dont really like all the ads at all"
"I cant be asked using Google Play Games to login to have the chat experience I had before all this censorship. Unless you change the login to other methods,  then Im done with this game."
This is not fair they said the submerge map is july25 but now its the oposite im so exsited for the submerge map to update but it makes me mad i gave it a 1 star thats what they get ive been waiting for this to happend but never did innersloth were the submerge will arrived pls tell me...Full ReviewThis is not fair they said the submerge map is july25 but now its the oposite im so exsited for the submerge map to update but it makes me mad i gave it a 1 star thats what they get ive been waiting for this to happend but never did innersloth were the submerge will arrived pls tell me
Really nice game would rate it 5 stars if there was a chat for kids.
This game sucks. It was amazing until you updated it. It actually sucks. You cant type that makes it hard to play and you barely get impostor. You only get impostor if your lucky or if you use hacks. Terrible. Terrible.
"the game chat makes it hard and boring to speak,  the game is much more boring with the new account set up"
YOU HAVE RUINED THE GAME. THE CHAT IS HORRIBLE BECAUSE WE SPEAK LIKE AI. THE SHUSH SCREEN IS LAGGY. PLZZZZ FIX THIS AND GIVE US THE CHAT BACK.
Before it was enjoyable now it is was kind of boring to play.. bring back the old one it is interesting
Worsttt update it was better first now we have many specifications before we could type but now we have useless feature it has deproved most before update it was much much better but now it has become a shittt
Hi I love this game but whenever I try to change names it does not let me do it so can you fix all of that but over all this game is super nice.
This game have to receive 5 star but it cant because of some people who type abuse word in the chat.
I love this game also can you give players more chances of getting imposter its hard I said can you make more of the hats and skins free
I dont like the new chat and how you cant write what you want I like the new colors and the new map but I dont like how you cant pick your own name please fix this things it would be way more fun
Its a good game but I wish that we were able to type our own chat instead of Judy some options
"Slow loading,  no option for making frnds,  if we switch network it take us to the lobby."
I loved the game before the update were you have to sign in to be able to chat freely.
"I love this game but the chat is ridiculous,  I am tge patent and it wont send me the email so how can I give myself permissions when I cant even get the email On top of that how can I give permissions to my children is I cant get the email"
The game is very nice there fifteen player idea is best because airship is a big map and 10 people playing but fifteen player is best in airship i am waiting for the submerged map and road way map to come then this game will go to the next level bro
This is an amazing and fun game an I really love the new stuff that has been added and soon to be added.
"Hmmm this is a game where you need to discuss things,  how should we improve it Remove most methods of discussion of course Except for the people that give us their social security number or their credit card information to verify theyre an adult"
One of the best games I have ever played and their are no ads.good game for free.
I really like the new updates on the game. And also vent cleaning task is the best task you have made. I still rate it five stars.
"The game wont open for me every,  time i open the game kicks me out so for that reason i give it 1 star"
Yaiks not nice game it is actually good but the new update is very very very bad the new map is nice but now in this new update there is no free chat and cant even use names we like and I dont want to make an account to get free chat like literally without free chat now it is on 1000 or somethi...Full ReviewYaiks not nice game it is actually good but the new update is very very very bad the new map is nice but now in this new update there is no free chat and cant even use names we like and I dont want to make an account to get free chat like literally without free chat now it is on 1000 or something in best games list if innersloth will add free chat and use names we like back then I am damn sure that it will come in 1 and I know that u disable those because to prevent bad words but please
Among us is so fun I love being imposter I got all my friends to play the only bad thing is that when I start my screen freezes but this game is amazing I love it 
I love the game just a few things I hate. 1.you cant choose your own name and the names that they give you are NOT pleasant 2.you have to say the stuff they give you and the stuff they give you to say do not even make sense And I get it you dont want kids to have inappropriate names or say inapp...Full ReviewI love the game just a few things I hate. 1.you cant choose your own name and the names that they give you are NOT pleasant 2.you have to say the stuff they give you and the stuff they give you to say do not even make sense And I get it you dont want kids to have inappropriate names or say inappropriate things But if you do see this could you maybe think about changing it back and if you do change it back you could make it so that we can notUse cuss words in our names or say them (
Its a very nice game but we cant text antnits so slow with the internet fix it please but its good to play
"Hello,  I updated the game and it is asking me for the downloadable content. I pressed accept then it made me wait,  I left the phone on for hours it was still downloading. I cant play among us if I dont download the content please help "
"Its quite disgusting after the update, when I used to play before it was just amazing now it can be rated 0 stars but its not just in option"
Game has been freezing up like crazy and its been getting really annoying.
This is a bad game. I cant use free chat mode.I have given the guardians e.mail adress but the is no massege. I have tried 10 times. Please give us free chat back..
i hate the new update because you cant change your name or wight what you want and you can change how much inposters like i tried to play among us with 1 inposter but when i joined it had 3 inposters
"Ok no,  I just went back to play this game and you cant even use your key bored to talk to your fellow cremate. This has made the already boring and repetitive game a million times worse. I mean honestly just why"
Way too many hackers now. It really ruins the game when someone pops in with an anti ban cheat and sets off all the sabotages and locks all the doors.
I use to like it how it was until they wont let us type what we want to type and pick our name and right now how this game is going I dont like it because for those reasons.
Love it  It is among us so yeah....important rule I gave it 4 stars because I had not played it until 1 week ago super fast game Play it NOW
"Pretty great i love IT and u should add Olive Aqua navy violet pastel, red, orange, yellow, Green, blue, purple, and pink make sure All pastel plz and update the logo"
The game was good but with the update its so hard to play you need a account and its so much lag please make it how it used to be
I give 4 star because update I very very miss old among us when I download 1 time I will enjoy change name itseand and chat but this new update is very bad I dont like it plz return old update
Great game but some glitches because it goes black but still great game and and some new skins for free
"Such a disgusting update I dont wanna give any stars but for the complain I have to, when there was option for typing and giving name was easier and fun"
I like the game so Im going to rate it a 3 because the is a just has some bad updates like you make a burger like what And how one kid was doing a prank on a 5 year old kid on YouTube and said he had a heart attack and I think thats not true but still.
This app was great before the update we were able to chat and change our names. I request to bring back the version of among us it was the great one.
I preferred it when u can type what u want to say the new way is too hard if they change it back I will give it a 5 star Please change it back
the new update is nasty. you cant chat and its not reminiscent of an old school video game. do better.
I. Love. This. App. And its newest updates... I cant tell. that is awesome I love this so much Like hell yeah Awesome awesome i dont have any other words to describe this game U have to try this. Whoever reading this.

This is kinda alright for kids but has some voilence u can shoot and kill if ur imposter it not scary and its a alright game for like almost teens but for 5 year old not good bc voilence
This game is the best. But Im giving three stars because I cant play the game as an imposter and thats the only problem in this game

The game is not very good because when I became a imposter crewmate always vote me and get me out when I havent kill or shoot somebody
Among us is one of my favorite games...but among us has gotten boring..now...but its still one of my favorite games and I still play it
The game is kind of fun but I cant even join a server anymore it just loads Nd I cant make a server to fix this but please.

"Decided to replay since i was bored,  ever since the update the game got worse,  i cant chat,  i cant even chat when theres a dead body reported,  cant change name without making an account,  i am disappointed"
This game is addicting but sometimes it wont let me enter the game and its lagging...

But when i said i am imposter and tapped a car from force .evwrones mouth was opened . I lovedit
Okay I used to play this game ALOT but ever since the update came out Ive lost interest and what I really hate is the new chat feature thing 
Bring back the chat when you can chat freely and remove the quick chat (Edit thanks for the reply and the update is good ). )
Its a nice game but after a update its like having a no mood to play this game.... I would like to give it 4.5 star but after a update it gone having a game like this so... I am going to give it 2 star

The connection issues are becoming a problem when i host or join public games it says an error message pls fix this
its fun game but why didnt they add the gold color or silvier coler and a few bugs and glitches
I loved among us but since the update it has been the worst game in2021 I used to play it with my friends it used to be so much fun right when the update came me and my friend hated it we deleted it in 5 second when we saw the update please change the update
I like this app but the fact that you have to have an account to make a username and to chat  So Im giving it a 2 star rating 
"i love this game and all but i have one question,  how did this become famous in 2020 it was made a few years ago it got a update but evryone got addicted to this game."

"Chat can be unlocked again now,  but this setting should be on by default."
I have loved the game until the new update.I have tried to play a game and create one but it says I must have an account (which I do)and it keeps on not working

Needs to go back to the typing of the chat during meetings and there should be a report button on somebodys name that gives them a warning for inappropriate language
I loved this game before the new update it was tolarable at first but when i join a piblic lobby the game crashes i realy hate it
This game is best in online games under 100mb . But there is problem I dont get imposter only in ten games I get imposter 2 times and 2 imposter in five games is very rarely I get .pls fix
"I love this and sometimes I have some black rooms,  and a bug comes every update, "
"Really like this game,  but now it wont work please fix it"
Absolutely terrible get rid of quick chat feature the glory days of among us is over i am shocked it has 3.6 stars and that is probaly from peopel who dont want it to die but know its dying

"Among us is a great game,  although I cannot be a pro at imposter mode and make sure to give this 5 star too "
The characters look a little cartoonish for a murder mystery but still pretty cool
Its an great game but people that are not the smartest play this and do random things it anoyying why di the even have quick chat it ruined the game you have turn off bad words so why do you need it
"Was really fun,  had cool updates bring back free chat,  sensor chat has always been there for ppl who dont want to see crude language"
The Game Is Amazing I Love Playing It But... I Wish They Added A Thing Where We Can Friend Other Players That Would Be Cool But Other Than That The Game Is Amazing

"Good game,  im mostly the impostrt.The reason i gave it a 4 is because of the chat ya know, we cant type in anything we want so can u change that please."
Its not love by me but I do like it dont know why this is a game it is a good but like its not wow anymore sorry 2stars its was fun 2019 but 2021 one update is not the best I think they went too far with it but its its ok
U love this game but the new up date were you cant type anymore I dont like it I do like the new skins but I CANT TYPE WHAT I WANT ITS HARD TO PLAY
This game is fun but quick chat is very bad and slow and also being very confusing
Among Us is so much fun and you can be the Imposter or the crewmate and I love being the Imposter its so much fun killing everybody not real killing though and this game I give it five stars because I love playing it please play this out its so much fun
This game use to be great but the new update make a lot of people cant chat so it so hard to communicate
I have problem. When i close my data i whant to play but the scren is still loding very long time. But when i opan my data then the scren not loding pls fix
Hello Innersloth. The vent cleaning task is so cool but... i saw that you need to sign in. but i dont lile the idea of that. please just let us type properly like before.
Hey Innersloth So uhhh yea I think it would be even more fun if you added voice chat to the game no discord no nothing just the game it self yeah sooooooooooooo see ya
"Screen goes black whenever I joinca a game,  plz fix this. It happens on all my devices["
I love this game but the only thing is it is kinda boring Im annoyed that there are the meetings its annoying lol
I hate how on some platforms the tasks are impossible The quick chat just sucks but I like how your on a ship who knows if your safe or not
I love this app but the thing is that on my phone i cant make an acount so i cant use normal chat and make good conversation with people but everything else is perfect
Nice but sometimes lags in between I enjoyed playing this but if U keep playing for a while U may get bored of it
Since March Ive being playing with my friends and now the update is soooo bad Im sorry but what is this.So many bugs So laggy and other stuff like the in chat
I love this but the reason for one star is new update version . In this we can not write any massaseg .. so thats why ..
Its good and all but i wish they kept the chat normal instead of clicking your words
This Game Is So Is Lots Of Fun And The Inposters Killing sound is Good and The Inposter Kill is so Adicting AND LOTS OF CREWMATES and 3 is the maximum of Inposters.
"it is very fun i love how the players are made and the walking is so cute,  the tasks oh is so hard and easy to. i love this game"
"Its fantastic,  But conversation between crew members is not proper way. If we allow to type in conversations is would be better"
"They removed free chat and now you have to have an,  account and all that. Its just not fun any more."
Remove Quick Chat Quick chat is bad because you need to pay for normal chat so please please remove quick chat Just to also say add a clean emergancy meeting button task. From Eyes Of Wonder P.S Still Love you Among Us
Normally I would put five stars but i keep getting kicked out of the game whenever the host starts the game
This is boring to be honest besides Im uninstalling this game because when there a meeting or a dead body reported its very hard when you text I will install it again when the text is gone
Nice game But gradually it had became a bit boring.....at we are becoming imposter very little time...pls improve it
I can find a game it just loads for lifetime to find a public lobby Audio is choppy Bugs bugs and bugs
Its good but why cant we type messages instead of selecting. Otherwise the game is awesome
"I loved it until we had to have an google play account, I can even change my name and the animation isnt good anymore"
"First you need to download this game yet after downloading this you need not to play it,  you need to download more 62mb additional file may virus. Then download google play and after a lot of nonsense days you start understanding this unsatisfactory game"
The game is good You can meet new people and can team up with so of the crewmates to get out the impoters
I met some friends in this game unfornately i had to leave my friends they were legit so fun and openminded i rlly miss them u guys should add a add friends button i would be happy about this
It was fun when we could actually talk and low key the game is not fun anymore I hate playing and not being able to Express how I feel and tallkg to others I feel if they dix this the game will be more fun and more popular .
"I like everything about the game,  but the reason I gave it a fourstar rating is because there is a ballon hat and no deflated ballon hat pls make deflated ballon hat and I will play all day in da next update D"
Such a bad game after an update cant even join a server . Saying Ive been disconnected from server everytime.
You have listen to you players and brought back the game to the stage we all love it. Thanx for bringing the chat but mostly thanx for awesome game
I really love that game it helps me get over my sickness by playing with friends and stuff so i hope their is more games like this bc this is so cool i mean i love being the killer i mean when u make friends u show them that ur the killer then they trust u and dont rat u out some people are tock
Its an awesome game with lots of action but I wish you could type whatever you want in it
Ok first things first I hate that you cant type what ever you want to anymore please bring this back in the game other then that this game is amazing
This game was nice you destroyed your game because of update if you dont bring update this game would me most downloaded game but you make autochat thats impossible to explaine and before update everyone was playing good but you destroyed your game
"Really annoying new chat feature,  just makes it stupid and hard to play. Im just uninstalling."
This game is good .But know its just trash .Unable to chat in this game.You have to send prewritten msgs.
This game only has 1 mode I mean can you add Hide and seek mode and some other modes that can make this game better..
"the game is wonderful now I have new colors and I can write on chat and Im always an imposter and and we are 15 people among us and when I do a game everyone join in 5 seconds or 2 seconds ,  I will give you 5 stars "
Love the game but I cant connect to servers that you have to enter a code to get into. Its disappointing 
I LOVE THE NEW MAP. But I cant actually type anything in though I was born in 1980 so it doesnt let me type only quick chat
Guys plz add levels in the game so everyone could get new costumes and pets.....or do something that everyone could gets fee costumes and pets
It doesnt allow me to enter the app always a black screen then to the home screen of my device thats why its a 1 star reveiw
I hate how they added a weird thing to were you cant say whatever you want I mean its stupid Please fix that like nobody likes how we cant say whatever we want I loved it before all these updates but now I dont like it
Cool game though but I cant play with a friend I know please fix that in the next update
"I liked this game earlier but after the updation we cant change our name, cannot even do a free chat we have to sign in for this which is not possible for some of us therefore if you are downloading this game be carefull"
With the updates I lost all my pets I paid for and more. Makes me not want to play anymore and sure will not be spending anymore money in this game.
Like it that it works but the 2 stars are for 1. When Game starts its a black screen and 2. Cant play freeplay
Whyyyy it was a great game b4 the glitches innersloth should fix these bugs right now or i go uninstall  without the bugs its a good game ....
It is good but I dont like if you didnt sign up with your email it wont let you choose your name or chat what you want to say.
"Very good game. No ad burst,  nice gameplay and concept. Got my very rare 5 star"
Boring some few years ago game was too fun but after upgrade it not that intresting and new map makes us bored and the old chats was fun that we can chat but bow its not that fun
"Finding imposter is easy,  Most people in public lobbies are idiots,  New account update make it impossible to explain yourself."
"This is a good game and I recommend 100,  but the reason its 4 is cuz i need there to be an friend request system plzzzz. Itll be a 5 if you just add that"
i like the new map but get rid of randomize name so people can have theyre own names again and get rid of chat things so people can say theyre own stuff again
It is only 3stars becuase that you need a account to have quick chat and to change your name it annoys me otherwise it is a good game.
wow. This game is awesome I can change my color and I can get a pet but its not for free but I still want to get it and I get it
i do like the game but the quick chat is very bad the typing had security from cyber bullying.
This game is the perfect game ever .and some changes you should keep no.1 create a new map called submerged and it should be beaneath water  after all of this its the best detective game
Yeah this is a nice game before the update. We cant chat what we want now. The old one was 10 times better yeah its sad
Well its a good and fun game but you need to remove quick chat its very annoying.
Really fun would rate 5 stars but Im not to happy with the last few updates. Recommend to play
I used to like among us until they came out with a new update where you cant write what you want in the chat box And you cant choose your own name
We cant write our own name without signing in and the random names are very useless the server always kick you out.it was a good game before update
Awesome but people still can curse in chat but I is a perfect game but how a bout an map creator that would be fun and pls approve of the submerged map I really want the map
Would be better if I could actually type on mobile devices instead of prompts. Other than that its fine.
Love it But in store I cant click on anything or buy anything. Help
bruh this game was god damn amazing idk who on earth had the idea of updating nd close the chat system i even stopped playing it ..overall i loved this sm..but plz make the chat system like before update the new map is rlly cool nd fun to play only issue is the chat system
Its a good game but when I sign in it makes it where I can change my name but I cant use free chat) But what can I say its still a good game 
Unsafe for children. You can name yourself and your character anything. People and possible child predators will name their room 13 years old only looking for gf I even came across a room today that had HATE LGBTQ as its name. Not ok.
"Hey, i cant chat or give response during the game..its so annoying not to reply during the chats..how can I fix this"
This app is the best it even has mods which is so CoOl but the one problem when you updated the game it wont say my role anymore i die instantly and its so stupid please fix this bug its so annoying ill rate 5 stars if you fix this bug
Among us you need to change quick chat to how it was like you could just say what you wanna say and the quick chat is very confusing
Is a very good game a lot of famous people play this game 910 because there os a glitched part of the walls which you can go through and no one can see you if it wasnt for that it would be a 1010
Its a good game afterall but why did you change the Chat People dont even understand what were saying and yes i know theres a lot of people say bad stuff but thats okay its oart of the game SO PLS CHANGE IT BACK And lagging so much than My phone
Good but i honestly think the update abt signing in is not ok cuz many kinds play this game and they would like to chat too uk but all in all this game is good
"This was a great game but after new updates it become really boring,  many bugs and new features are just failure  please fix it"
"This game is really nice but u should add some stuff likefriend request, free stuff and more maps"
Good game but the new update was worse then the 911 you can barley talk at all if you can talk freely you hacked the game or glitched talking was my favorite part but now I dont play among us except for when Im so board that Roblox isnt fun
"This is Frustrating everytime I sign my account,  in Among us,  its not working,  its shown,  Faild something went rong like this. And I dont have free chat how I will do this"
Havent played in a long time. Omg it has been changed so much and not fun anymore. No chat Lame
Idk why but I cant join any games. It wont load and codes dont work. Other then that the game is good
Its a really and i say REALLY good game try it out for your self maybe this will peak your intrest but the game is not as good as before now its where your choice what to say before these udates you should write now it aint so good as before
I cant chat because I dont know if theyre doing is a game it didnt work the shading is broken for me
The new stupid version is bad I cant chat free and like that I would chat normally it takes time just to say its not me like please fix that
Its great but the quick chat thing is not making the game fun cuz if i speak like a bot and thats no fun so innersloth pls pls pls pls pls fix this bug just pls and have a great day
I kinda like this game but in da videos was showing a scary among us  game without a face on it with out a face on it its scary but with a face its not scary at all though...
Terrible wont even load not to mention the fact it cannever find and rooms to join. Its so laggy Needs fixing asap
"the report button is heavily bugged please fix it,  and hackers seem to be more common then ever."
"This is the best game,  the matter is sabotaging if I sabotabe it will on after2 sec otherwise it is the best game "
Its ok the game is good but like the chatting you have to choose its harder for imposters to win so its not that fun anymore
I really like it but I do like it when they let us type the word that we want I dont like when its like you need to type the word that they have I rate it 5 stars
I like it but only the problem is of name and the free chat. I LOVE THE AIRSHIP MAP
I cant enter other server using a code... Its always say didnt found the game but everything is ok... Just I cant enter using code
Love the game The Imposter is really fun to play good now everyone agrees with me so you need to make the chances a little higher Barbie but everyones o one though
This was such a good game but the quick chat ruined the game we cant blame the developers of among us we can blame the toxic people and kids so please among us developers can you remove the quick chat in 2 or 3 months cause we have the report button so if there is inappropriet chat we can report th...Full ReviewThis was such a good game but the quick chat ruined the game we cant blame the developers of among us we can blame the toxic people and kids so please among us developers can you remove the quick chat in 2 or 3 months cause we have the report button so if there is inappropriet chat we can report them and you can give them time out with quick chat for a couple hours or a few days just dont do it for a really long time okay and every time the timeout is done you can send a notification thank you.
At first when they had like no quick chat it was the best game ever please give us option of turning off and on quick chat
"Keep getting kicked off every other game its annoying,  as well as some as my friends."
This game is awesome mind blowing fantastic fabulous amazing and this new version is fun thank but plz remove quick Chat and Release a new map as soon as possible
Terrible the old version was a whole lot better it was a whole lot less cartoony now its just stupid
The game is nice but every one is banning everyone from their game for no reason please make a update that there is no ban button and Im getting crewmate everytime please fix these problems
Finally a game with NO adds and I am only giving it a 4 star rateing because people are acting like ttheyre idotsdumb I think they do it on purpose but over all greatawesome game try it
"The chat is horrible,  I cant say other choices,  its weird plus the update is disgusting is stupid,  the chat in among us is dumb. Update it"
GOOD game but the chat system is very bad. Please improve it.
I tried to chat in during the game and it wouldnt let me. You need to fix this for mobile players
Thank you for changing the chat mode in settings now its not that laggy too the game is much fun now thanks
If only i could rate this game 0 stars. i used to love it and now its bearly playable. do not recommend 
Good game but whenever i saw a player near body and i reported it and in quick chat i try to enter that persons name in does not reflect and i get voted out so beter remove quick chat update
The update on Among Us change the game so now if you want to get a friend in on the game that you started it doesnt work because of the update
Fantastic game. Love playing and it has never given me any issues
"As the game grows,  it becomes better and better I personally love the game,  especialy it is related to THSC (The Henry Stickmin Collection),  it made me love this game even more Ty for the wonderful game Innersloth devs "
"This is the best game ever  I love it sooooo much  But I want that pls,  remove the account making system. I dont have much space in my phone to download Google Play. Pls remove tge account we can chat freely. Otherwise THIS GAME IS THE BEST "
Among Us is a fun murder mystery game but it can get kind of boring after a while.
"You should never download this game coz its worthless,  no fun and its control is worst and the most bad part is chat consumes way too much time we arent able to chat"
Cant play when trying to conect online it just loads forever. Hosting it is just a black screen. Is good if you can play
I wish u did not have to make a account because when I try to play it says something about guardian and I tried everything it still dont work. I want to play with my friends but I cant.
I like the old among us than now it just because I love that most is the old one than now but I dont know why but yea thats why my mind knows..... But I like that update tooo because theres a Berger  task and I love it so much 3 if you read this your a cute person in the world 3
Its really good but can you guys take away the you have to log in just to play among us other than that a 5 star
"Mostly fun,  especially with friends. The new 15 player update is great as well."
I really dont like when we have to use something different in the chat I wish it was back to normal but still a fun game
I dont play it anymore bc the chat there is no more typing just funny to see how people just play around and I miss that I hope you can fix your problems
"The game itself is good,  but the update kind of ruined it. I mean you can just filter chat to make it so no one can cuss but still"
"Look,  please respond. Everytime i click join public game,  the three dots simultaneously go green and wont load me in. Im putting 45 because of the problem. Please respond on how to fix then i will put 55."
This is boring.i crash every single minute and this is bad. IM Never Using this App Again And I Deleted it. And I App It Used to be good and now you cant chat your own. And still cant chat my own. Hiw i chat my own again
The game needs modhack protection. The amount of times I finally get imposter and get caught because of cheaters is so frustrating.
I dont like the new update . Cant type what we want . Also dont have indonesian language . Sorry not all people use English . Its wasting of time to find the right word im quick chat
I love this game but the update that came (quick chat) ruined it now i cant play with my friends because the game is much more annoying then before
Not so great. Overall gameplay has become very terrible and so has almost everything with the updates. Would not recommend
This is one of the best serial killing game for me. You need to find the impostor with a proof(like a detective) or kill crewmate secretly. Love this game. I hope there is a detective on this game
This game is fun when you get imposter but it is literally rigged. So garbage. But everything else is great
I love this game but I hate the chat update because its difficult to use.please update the chat (
This games fantastic it would be 5 stars but the open vault task in cargo bay is impossible please make it slightly easier
I wish there were a crewnate swat role with guns A lot of guns.Wait. I hate all of these maps. Add the new prison map PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. thank you
I didnt know that they added new colours and more players its super fun I remember when it first came outbtw when will mods come out 
VERY GOOD GAME.... BUT THE OLD ONES IS TOO GOOD BUT THE NEW IS NOT... BECAUSE IN OLD ONE AMONG US ITS GOOD TO HIDE BODIES AND PEOPLE ALSO LIKE ITS SO PLEASE FIX THIS THE BODY IS SMALL.......... PLEASE FIXED ITTTT....
It not a bad game but i cant login and cause of that i cant write so can you let the one that not login have the ability to write using keyboard pls
"Horrible updates this game has to offer,  the accounts,  the quick chat. Those updates are horrible,  congrats for ruining the game."
I like it but I play play again its restarting that one star 1 I gived the 4 stars because awesome that playing but thanks pls fix it it again again restarting that im worry ( Bye.
Idk whats wrong it just stops responding in the middle of the game and everything shuts down......i used to love it but now it sucks plz fix
Can u may please fix the bug in the new map Everytimes the emergency meeting is end Im always stuck I cant move please fix itt
"I used to love this game,  but with the removal of the free text and all of the collusion I will no longer be playing."
"Before quick chat,  I used to play this game every day,  but when quick chat ubdate was instaled,  I got off and plsyed something else,  so please get free chat back."
I love this game If you would consider creating an add friend option that would be AMAZING
The game is worst and we cant free chat like before update why you remove free chat Why plz bring it back so I can give 5 star or your game is worst
This game is a waste of time. They dont have proper servers set up after years of being a popular game so good luck trying to stay in a game for more than 5 minutes. Innersloth are exactly like their mascot. Lazy pieces of garbage.
I like playing this game. The part where I cant type and I cant change my name makes people dont know me and the part I cant type is where the part I dont play anymore.

The part where I cant type and I cant change my name makes people dont know me and the part I cant type is where the part I dont play anymore. And I played this game and when I was the imposter Im so happy. But when somebody started an emergency meeting or report a dead body. I lie that it isnt me. That feels embarrassing. But when the timer finishes. I cant move and the kill button doesnt cooldown. Its just 45 seconds forever. I like the game cause of memes
"Not full rating because there r people who swear and say bad words. And... there are multiple hackers that done let us enjoy it,  but its an amazing game to play with friends."
"It is so much fun,  highly recommend. It puts your brain to the test,  just dont get caught"
As a kid this was horrible I used to love this game but it changed so much my mom is cheap so she cant pay 50 cent for a game Horrible service
I think we should be able to add friends and invitejoin them but overall the game is awesome
I just want to say this game is fun untill the new update because we cant chat what we want to say and need to sign in.
One of the best game space game in the world but there two problems 1 I get disconnected number 2 I lagg a bit
The game is great. Just lacking Voice Calls when on emergency meeting.
Please make chatting on . We dont like this chat system . Get back typing system. And get back naming method .
"Nice game but I have problems and tht is ... Why we cant chat whatever we want only we will cant write bad words and second why we cant make or set our name by us you are giving names by yourself ,  WHYyyyyy"
The game is really fun  but the thing is that i was always the crewmate only sometime get imposter can you please make us like almost every game the imposter please
I love the game but why i give this game two stars because it cant chat clearly plss no spectate the words or chat.. plss fix it
I rate this game a 4 star beacause sometimes i would become the host of my own game and then among us kicks me out of my server saying that i was hacking their game when i did nothing wrong
I like this game its really fun to play but the one thing I dont like is the new chat but apart from that Its a really good and fun game
This game was my favourite if there wasnt a stupid update where I cannot choose my favourite name thank you for this game but just remove that stupid I recommend Roblox and blockman go and this game I love these all games well everybody the best part no ads love it bro
Wont let me load up public matches but my internet works fine. Please fix. One Plus 8T
"Amazing game Play it with your friends and you will have a blast Edit it rlly sucks right now and I cant change name,  or what I type Very bland and udll used to be fun and played with with my friends now it sucks"
Thanks for your response this is my favorite game but the chat is not nice now its ok you are the best because any they dont give response fast like you. thanks. I am not able to change the chat 
This game was nice but the new update was worst and there is a problem in chat to
it was a fun game until the new update has come its hard to to tell the people like i need to choose the chat
Im glad they have fixed the chat option.... now I can play ... thank you ^_^
Mabey if you bring back free chat that would be great plus when ever i sign in to the game it doesnt for some reason so can you please change this please
"When it first got popular,  it was perfect. The recent updates,  not letting you pick names,  or even freely speak has killed it"
I used to love this game but not anymore i tell you why because the new update was driving me crazy and i cant change quick chat only i hope you fixed and one more thing i dont want them to name me
Its fun but I dont like how the chat is aredy chosen for you like its not letting you typ its just ready ugh.
The new updated is buged i cant type anymore so I cant say who the imposter is plz fix this or might Uninstalle it. editamong us devs if your reading this if you dont fix the chat this game may become dead
Love the app and the new updates like the free chat and new colors overall I think its a great app
I used to love this game till update.After update every thing got changed.i cant write i want in game and the game is now very bad as well.if possibel i would like to give 0 star.
"I have a bug on your game when Im enter the server ,  its just pitched black . I hope you can fix it"
Among us used to be fun u dont have to send an email to your guardian and I dont even have a guardian this is just bad now its all just bad I am very disappointed I want u to bring back the old among us thus one that is there now is just terrible absolutely terrible
"The chat feature is the most annoying thing in the world,  add the regular chat back."
Its always saying you disconnected from the server. Game has soooo many complains
Um I like this game its fun you get to do task and kill people as imposter put it can lag if you have bad internet.
"I loved this game before it was updated but now it is too boring to play before it was good this was my favorate game but now it is my least fav game I did not expect that are the update really bad This is just my opinion I think some loved the update but I hate it , I fell bad saying I hate this gam...Full ReviewI loved this game before it was updated but now it is too boring to play before it was good this was my favorate game but now it is my least fav game I did not expect that are the update really bad This is just my opinion I think some loved the update but I hate it , I fell bad saying I hate this game "
U have to sign in to talk freely and I give 5 star for ur hard work and I like the other update but still I like the game alot of people that did 1 star are sooo dum and ugly and the creator is cool awesome and smart I love this game so much thanks for reading my rate)
"Hello innersloth,  all the times I play I still cant join a game and I keep on trying but it says error. This is why I gave 2 stars"
"bug,  i cant playing this game. Loading so long. If can give 0 stars im already give 0 stars pls fix bug"
Its my humble request to the users that pls you change the communicating chamber. Previously we could easily state that who was the imposter and moreover it was very good but now it has gone worse. Pls fix it. Plsssssss. 
"I dont know why in the world thay added the quick chat feature, i was excited about the airship feature but now they end up like this"
They ruined the game old version was best now it shows error and you cant change your name also you cant chat now it sucks
Its a good game I used to play many times among us but now that you cant talk freely its not the same anymore
You need to fix the chat in meeting because me and my frends cant tipe in the chat box. But other than that your game deservs 5 stars.
"Thanks for Fixing those old Mistakes and for adding 15Max players PerWaiting Lobby,  plus More choosable colors and the Vent Cleaning Task i Guess............Still THANKS 10, 000"
I know u cant show cursing but just dont let us type it in the chat box Im just bad at trying to get myself clear or blame someone without dying because I dont know where the chat things are literally takes me 3 minutes to find it was black name the same for names I know just block it dont make...Full ReviewI know u cant show cursing but just dont let us type it in the chat box Im just bad at trying to get myself clear or blame someone without dying because I dont know where the chat things are literally takes me 3 minutes to find it was black name the same for names I know just block it dont make us do this thing I just getting voted because I dont know where things are on the chat thing
The game is cool and i like the new tasks but the chat system is now u get to pick a chat and u cant even write on the chat system
"Please make a ColorBlind mode which fixes the color than color blind people see,  to normal."
this game was great because we can type whatever we wanted but now its hard to type and figure what to check
"I hate it. You cant even choose your own name anymore,  type what you want,  and they changed so many this that didnt need changing its awful"
It was a very fun game but when they made it so u can only type a few things
"The new parental features are stupid,  you have to pay to chat and have a custom name like what This has ruined the game"
I cant even play a single match its not accepting me why.... I cant even create a room I cant even join the room.... Whats wrong in this game... Please fix this
Well I think is really annoying that if you leave a game on purpose you cant play for 5 minutes
Nice I like it but the chat is so boring please give type option so everyone one can enjoy the chat also but very nice game

It takes sooo long for me to get in the like when the game starts it takes so long for me to get in the game and fully move....and i would give it 5 stars if you could remove that and ima childs.you got a promblem
I love this game but the new update isnt too much and doesnt let me play l join but then when the match starts it then shows black screen
It was amazing until that last update game We want the same simplified experience before where thier was no accounts and the chat is just so dumb right now
I realy dont like this game because I just started this and when I went to practice mode then they just only taught me how to play but did not let me play at all . Im uninstallinging this now. THIS IS RUBBISH
Used to be a great game. But then yall messed with the chatting and screwed over the whole game
"The game removed custom names and cant talk in any way,  please return these features back to the game."
"Too cartoonish player model and the shh screen, bring old model and shh screen ("
i want to give it a 5 star but the new update ruined my gameplay....we cant chat properly....plz..fix this
Nice game. U just have to sign in then u can chat easily. I love this game
this game is awsome and me my freinds love it the maps are awsome so are the grahics this game deserved to be best game of the year. a must play game the new colers are epic and if you dont play it novisor will track you down
This game is fun but I dont really like the new update with the chat features other than that I love playing among us with my friends
Best game ever but quick chat has to have a words you can add on too and a clear button.
"Can we go back to the 2020 version,  like the September version of the game were it was more simple than this please "
"I hope you have better protection against hackers. They make the game a livinghell. I just played in a lobby with very fun people,  then a hacker joined and ruined the game. We didnt even have a proper goodbye."
After the update I dont think its that fun cause you cant chat with your friends in game they only give options _
The game is good but i cant join it keep kicking me so one star  also there is lag
Its great but. Can you try to ban hackers and mods And the chat system sucks now please fix it.
"Fun at first,  but the game gets stale and repetitive quickly."
"I cant play this with new version,  but i can play an older version. This is my only worst game ever."
it is almost the best game i have played but since the chat has turned off it is difficult to communicate
I LOVED among us but that new update with the new chat and stuff that ruined it because u cant make a FULL sentence with SENSE and nobody listen and its hard to find and get the words in MY OPINION
"Among us is so fun I love getting impostor,  sabotaging lights,  and taking out the ppl that come to fix lights"
Good game but can improve ..........some glitches should be fixed
Is a good game but the new chat thing it bad it hard to talk to people I like the text to speech
I love this game but every time i try to join a map it eighter says game started or game ended
The game is amazing but there is a problem in the servers it is not working well like before so please fix it innersloth
I have LOVED this game but now it wont even let me play because when I tap online and find game it wont even load that is a lot of bs
I love it but its annoying a bit no names and update is not better when i load in the game starts it kicks me out
The server is down right now this is proble a few time thing but yeah or I think it happens more times but still fix it
Fix the lights they are buggy I cant see at all sometimes and when I can its choppy
I love the game They changed the quick chat for me so I could chat I could change my name )
Theres still hackers that will make the lights unfixable and will make everyone sit while the body discovered screen play over and over
Wow among us has taken over the Internet it has more downloads then minecraft more people playing it right now then minecraft soon to be top game in the world nice gaming and idk what other soggy teenagers are talking about there are no more glitches anymore lol nothings wrong
Fix Among us Plz Im having trouble with quick chat and the stupid names u cant get details when u find impostor and people without quick chat is making fun of meh name Plz Fix It Ill rate it to 5 star if u fix Among us I been playing when among us came out
Its really fun but it always cut whenever Im an impostor and that stinks update the game for a better connection cuz it stinks in that aspect
Honestly My experience wasnt the best cause the minute i open it up its full of sexual roleplay people getting banned for not having specific names and being kicked for no reason.
Its fun but laggy could you make it so we do not have to be kicked out of the server when playing offline
Love it you can free play in free p.ay you play by your self and there are dummys and you can become imp lol love it
"I really dont like this game anymore,  its so laggy. The gameplay is so bad it actually makes me want to punch someone. This game used to be good. What happened"
I gave 1 star because the game change then before the chat is completely useless and game hang sometimes . So we want previo among us
Its fine but I just dont like that we needed a account to accept chat and other things but its good . My little sister doesnt like it.....
This is a amazing game(and in polus in the toilets there is a light grey crewmate)i love the new airship map and all the new colours This is actually my favourite game i play it almost every day and one more time i love this game
Please add in voice chat it is really anoying when everyone votes you without a side of your story Pls add voice chat Typing is too slow
the update is trash and it does not let me play with friends and it doesnt work very well although it was popular it was very glitchy and bad
The chat is just annoying why did u do this...theres only choices on what to say. Its not fun like how it used to be.
I love among innersloth bring an update about new submerged map and new colour light blue not cyan do not remove cyan ok apart from that I like the game
Honestly this game was good before the airship update and now it is so laggy and cannot load properly please help with this bug
"Used to be a good game Full of errors,  weird updates,  chat is ridiculous,  people are leaving everytime. A big NO. From me People  Download Suspects  Its a better game "
"Dear developers,  i hope you add the Add Friend feature and friend list to play with them more and more "
"Game used to work fine when I first got it,  but now it says I have the wrong version and I cannot join any servers"
"The updates ruined it,  quickchat is terrible,  whenever i try to create an account it gives me an error and now it crashes on start on my android emulator"
Pls fix the downloading asset is not working my wifi is fast so pls fix this I hate it and when you start the game is just a black screen Pls fix this
This game is so nice and my favourite game but one thing if voice chat also available means worlds no.1 game will be happen
Among us is one of my favorite games it so fun of how you got to do task and survive from the fake crewmateimpostor.
Yes among us is good game new tasks all is well but plz change a glitch that if u open the report button to report a person it says everuone name left the game.. But its all nice a small bug hope u fix it awesome game
"I like the game,  but with the new update I cant join my friends because some chat stuff. Definitely deserves this "
It was good at first but the updates just werent it and now we cant have our own choices of chatting and we gotta make a account which sucks
It was a great game. But please change this so you can type its really not fun when you cant type.
Its a good game but the chat is annoying we cant eventype we have to use Auto words but it is still good you
Awesome but servers are slow and ppl shouldnt be able to get banned for no reason thats why I only gave it a 4
Wow this game is good but can you please fix the chat ones I hate it pls do it th n I will give 5 stars and the game itself is pretty good so 4 stars and also pls add the new roadmap i would like it
"I love this game,  Id give it 5 stars but I keep meeting nice people but theres no way to friend them. "
This was a nice game when it was launched... But nowwe cant even type when discussion started.
I gave it 5 stars because when I be imposter it fan but it needs more maps and no more chat box it needs mic to
This game taught me to never trust stranger this I love it so much keep this game going but please fix the bugs pls Good luck reaching the top game
I dont like it because u removed the free chat please enable the free chat to everyone its stupid and we cannot find the imposter..
Forced quick chat is the worsed thing about this game. It makes it so difficult to communicate.
"bugs really needed to be fixed there are thousands of bugs,  And hackers and modders please please fix."
"I love this game, but have increase graphics, if that every thing is amazing"
I have played it before and I like the game but on mobile its not loading and I cant play it I have tried everything and even redownloaded it but its still not loading
Keep getting disconnected from the server even before the game begins.
"It is a very fun game,  but there are only 4 maps,  so could we have more maps please"
Hey innersloth its a good game but when my wifi kept disconnected today it banned me for 5 minutes for intentionally disconnecting even though it disconnected me still a good game bur why a lot of the names are either sexual or normal might wanna look into that and stop blurring grape
Thank you for respoding but you didnt fix the BIG problem just can you remove the whole account thing no loging no signning in none of that LET US CHAT IN PEACE please 
This game is awesome but I wish there could be up to 100 people. The way you have to use that tap to text I hate it change it back
the quick chat terrible cant get imporstor for l once terrible . bann the people who are talking dumb but just fix the game i was having fun talking to players u just ruiend every thing
"This game is good,  but my keyboard sometimes just doesnt open so it makes the game impossible to play."
Good game but after the update very very very very very very very game i would give 0 if it was available plz make the chat system back to the old chat system
Used to be amazing fun with friends but just ruined when they added the chat wheel instead of custom messages
I agree with Violetmilee43 it was much better before the update 1.Cant use the chat 2.Cant change your name what kinda world are we living in
My brother cant play because he cant update stuff it needs to update on its own and it needs to be able where we can free chat without having a guardian to ask for permission and where we can change the names to whatever we want this was a bad bad new update innersloth
I HATE THIS GAME SO MUCH For 4 reasons Reason 1 why is this game so famous if its so stupid Reason 2 everyone is obsessed with this dumb game and its all they talk about Reason 3 Its horrible because this app is taking over other apps Reason 4 its just really stupid and it should ...Full ReviewI HATE THIS GAME SO MUCH For 4 reasons Reason 1 why is this game so famous if its so stupid Reason 2 everyone is obsessed with this dumb game and its all they talk about Reason 3 Its horrible because this app is taking over other apps Reason 4 its just really stupid and it should be gone forever
this game is good and all but you need to make it to where we can friend people and join those friends as well other then that its cool
Please fix the sign in issue and chat. Im hoping for the update thank you.
This is a really good game.But theres a glitch that whenever i play its so laggy.Please Fix This.And so you fixed it.Love from Imran Khan
"Cant change my name,  cant chat,  no respect for bugs,  green player with no name,  game ends befote start,  stuck in black screen fore ever..."
Sence the game has updated so much people cant even chat anymore but at least no more adds more people cant sign in bc its says error
Good game But pls add a hide seek mode Also some people say they cant type Solutiondownload play games then go to account then just make a account super simple as that
"I used to think this game sucked but since they have updated it,  the game is awesome I highly recommend this game. Thanks "
Tbh I love this game...its really nice and I Also love the new map its so cool and you could really buy skins and someting so yeah..
The new update is doo doo the whole sign in thing sucks if we are not signed in which many people arent its so impossible to play this game now before the update the game was good now its bad
In free play when Im in airship i sabotage in meeting room I see a helicopter out the window but I like that part you should try it out
I hate that u have to sign in to be able to talk and why is there quick chat Like who is going to use that
This game was once my favorite game but ever since the account system update this game just became boring because of it.Please fix this please
This game is just rigged the game itself just makes everyone confused no free chat Just quick chat quick chat is annoying you need an account to play
i hate this update about amoung us its to hard to pur what you want in the chat and half of the things in tje chat are rhings i dont wven want to talk about THIS UPDATE SUCKSSSSSSSS the old one was soooooooooooooo much easier ro control and so much easier to playyyyy RHE UPDATE SUCKKKKKKKKS
"The game used to be fun but the chat update ruined it, but its still a good game"
When the airship map came out Among us became worse. It was everyones favourite game. Why the sign thing Sometimes it doesnt even sign me in.
this used to be the BEST game but when you updated it it became the WORST game I cant even talk when in chat please I miss the old among us if you would please go back to the old among us I HATE the new update ITS THE WORST
This game is very fun ok.Its a amazing gameIt got more colorsAnd the new chat its fine innersloth LLC Small chat team.
"The first versions were better,  now they made it more strict and voting time infinite is dumb.."
you cant freely communicate. youre forced to choose their commands. very annoying
The reason I am giving it 3 stars is because it is cant type what is not on the chat options
It was great but the new update ruined it for me and now I sound like a robot and i want to say things with freedom.
"it is good game but it need to be upgraded like while i am playing there are some gliches,  so you need to improve"
"This game is AMAZING yes the quick chat is anoying but if you get permission its not a big deal,  aside from that great game"
This game is really good  funny ... And playing with friends on discord or conference call makes it more funny and enjoyable ... but the most irritating think is when u dont become an imposter in a whole day 
good but would be better if you can login without it giving a GoogleAuthNoToken error
Pretty good for game where you play as a imposter or crewmate that can be different colors
I love this game like this is so awesomeee but when the update the quick chat kinda riuned it i really like the old among us
This game was really fun last time I played it before the update but after the update game quality is so poor for example username and specialy CHATS I hate the chat update the quality is so poor I request can you pls change the chat update to the last one I get so so so confused how do I chat their
this is so cool and also i dont like being the killer i like being the crewmate cause i like the tasks but the killer you just have to try and kill everybody
The new submarine map is releasing in the end of the month best game ever and I am trying to summon molten but its not working but I love the game game
Soooo i rate this game 4 stars because its hard with the comments when youre a guest and when the past this game is better because the past game you can type anything and coztumize the name and why you delete the Filipino chat i played this in 2020 and this was a fun game before because you can an...Full ReviewSoooo i rate this game 4 stars because its hard with the comments when youre a guest and when the past this game is better because the past game you can type anything and coztumize the name and why you delete the Filipino chat i played this in 2020 and this was a fun game before because you can anderstand any lungue but i can understand English and Filipino but Im comfortable with English because Its more fun when you can anderstand any lungue and please remove the sign in
I liked it much better when u could write whatever u wanted it made the he so much more fun and aowed to talk to people andake online friends while waiting for players to join
Love this multiplayer game I like Adventures games and this game is right for me But can you fix the account error for me Please
I love the game but i did not like the chatbox its hard to communicate with your team.
I know that the chat update was so that there wasnt inappropriate stuff but just censor it dont change the whole chat system
I wish I could rate a fivestar but the Airship update went too far I wish you could chat I wish you could spawned in the cafeteria and you take away update
The game is so bad and boring it wouldnt be boring if its freaking among Us and wanted me boring if among Us want to add picking speaking and just typing yourself now that be fun but no they took it out 
"It is interesting game playing with friends but many issue comes So,  i am not satisfied.."
"The game is to gooooooood . But here something is missing ,  I am really missing my old days in this game . In old days I can write anything but now I have to follow the game and I cant write anything by me . I want that old writing borde plzzzz ."
"I love this game but i give 4 stars because there is no voice chat please add it ,  it will also helpfull to you and i will give 5 stars please add voice chat"
I can play free and game is very good I play with my brother and sister its working nice I love this game 
This is a great game but has Uno like qualities. Overall an amazing game.
The game was good in the past. But now it lame because there no more name changing and no more typing in chat
That one thing my problem is the chatting gives more upsetting cuz is just a waste of time to pick one pls bring back the old ones
Used to be super fun. Now when I try and play Im stuck on the loading screen.
I have a question innersloth why dont you remove the new chat feature like everyone hates it and you still didnt remove it you lost like half your players because of it
Theres just one thing I dont like and that is when someone leaves it leaves a message and it stays on the kick or ban thing
The chat wheel is a terrible addition. Its impossible to play or accuse anymore.
The game was super fun back then the update sucks I can barely even chat in the chat box fix it right now
Yes its a good game but screwed us with the update you may only use quick chat And cant type I will download once they make you be able to chat
This game sucks in the guest id I cant sign in for some reason pls fix this issue Im bored the game is soo bad in the guest id pls I will give it 5 star rate if u fix this issue
"Very time i try to sign in,  it wont work i tried so many times but never got to sign,  and can you make it where we can say what we want again Please and Thank you"
there is a lot of swearing in the chat and kids play this game and that is not appropriate for kids too see that. over all good game.
Good game nice but what is the problem is if we host it takes to much time to join
"Nice app,  but theres a problem it hope u can fix it pls,  Ive play this before and its a great game,  but now if i play it all i can see is dark.pls"
Ok when I first had it I loved it but when the update came I disliked it like it used to let u write what u want but now u have to choose what to say I hope u can fix it and Ill change my review from a 3 star to a 5 star thx.
I love it because last time I reacted to the new update and I was in safe chat I have not played it for a long time then I finally I can chat now
I cant find any servers only the people who signed in but when i signed out i saw a lot of servers please fix this problem
Please fix among us for us restore it to the old version and let the game rise again.For now I cant play the the game due to incompatibility with my phone
The text thing in there is just not good and its hard to find somethings the old chat is a lot better
Upgrades killed the game. Cough cough quick chat and finding words love the game overall
I still cant use free chat tha thing I want to do is just allow people to chat freely and allow people to write there own name. First among us was fun to play but now it is dumb please fix my issues thank you
This hame os fun but i wish we coild like get one or two pets and skins.All my friends have atlist one pet or skin i jave none thats just sad.
The best game I have ever played..... Just a few technical issues and quick chat needs to be fixed..... Awesome game
It was my fav game but when it updated it wasnt better than before and its not cool that ur parents need to use the credit card just for text eachother its absurd.
Its a amazing game but whenever I play the airship map its always lagging
"This game is honestly great,  just updates a lot but apart from that you should install it"
"This game was fine,  but when the update came and the new account system,  this game is trash,  why did you disable the chat and replace it with that dumb thing just why,  why does this game need parents permission r,  i cant play even im an adult sending a mail and dont say anything in it,  bunch of ...Full ReviewThis game was fine,  but when the update came and the new account system,  this game is trash,  why did you disable the chat and replace it with that dumb thing just why,  why does this game need parents permission r,  i cant play even im an adult sending a mail and dont say anything in it,  bunch of text,  who would read all of these change it. This game went from 44.5 stars to 3 stars after the update,  great,  keep going,  its already dead and the update make it even worse. Unplayable"
"My kids are obsessed with this game,  the obsession is so high that I have to take their phones away. But its okay,  because I love this game so much that my husband has to take away my phone too,  I love this game more than I love him. LOL"
"This game was fun before the new update . Now we cant chat proper , We Have random names and its Getting boring day by day."
This game is super awesome because you can play with friends and family and even people you dont know. Also you can make friends.
It is fun but that old typing is fun also please make it that sensor chat and typing chat when SUMBERGET is released please9 and i will 5 star it please3
Among us is perfectbut while the game startsthe screen to be quietthe crewmate guy is difrent in that picture Also i love being a ghost coz i can walk everywhere i want in the mapAlso i can walk in the sky too.Nice
yeah among us its pretty awesome you can get this for free 4 maps biggest is the 4th smallest is the 2nd pretty clean no lag love it and you should make the hands the cursor I think people would like that to
i love this game the only thing is the chat update it makes it sooo hard to tell the crewamates stuff and they vite me out help me plaese il liked the old one please replace it will be very helpfull
Played after a long time.. and not happy with the new chat setting Hope you all Change it developers.
Very fun me and my friends play together I really love playing Ive never incountered anything that would make me dislike it
I love this game and I love when you work hard to create this game but can you update this so we can choose are own names please ). Also can we say what ever we want please D
It was fun until they made it to where if your not signed in you cant use free chat
Latest update makes me cry bcuz the kick section become full when i kick and stop that character has left thing in kick section
I used to love the game but that was a month ago...now I hate it I dont get imposter so let me get imposter and make it 5050 for everyone to get imposter or I quit....
I like the update all the update except the meter chat thing.But when i go to a lobby and the host starts its just black pitch black
"A big thanks to devs for putting back on free chat,  now its 5 stars as always from me and ITS ALIVE once more Yaaay "
I had errors in this but thankfully innersloth fixed it but sometimes when i join a game it exits saying you were not able join it so plz fix this
Ok it was an amizing app but why I only dont get the chat option I had tryied a lot but I couldnt get the chat option only Quick Chat 
This game is awesome I love Id like the game better if u can get coins and get skins and hats but still awesome game
The game is the best game but please add submerged map in the next update with new hats and stuff please i love the map if you not add stars will go down (
I used to love this game but now it is ruined bring back the old chat ( and Ill come back
Its so fun to play I always play it but I wish it didnt have a time limit on when your in the Lobby and game
I really liked playing this game with my sis and brother until the update when you couldnt right what you want I
"the new update is just no .., it wont let you type freely heres a new idea , make it where you can add people bc you cant type freely uh yea its the new update ^"
This game i so cool  but its four stars cuz the chat thing we cant chat what we want plz get rid of the chat thing
I used to love the game but now its just stupid because the chat is different and wont let me type it also makes me sign into an account and I hate it so Im unstalling
I love this app in all but it keeps kicking me off of the servers and idk why this is happening but please fix.
You need to fix your game the reason why not that much people play your game is cause you disable peoples chat type and its difficult to speak facts without the chat where you can type yourself
Was a good game but completely ruined by the new chat feature as everyone votes for the person who reported it the first name said and they cant defend themselves
The game is cool. I just dont like the memes that much. In my opinion it makes me hate the game more every time I want to play it. The game is cool though no fuss.
This gane is very OK. My game stopped working 2 days after i installed. Also when i go to sign into my account the gamw just freezes
Whoever made it this is the best best of all time of oldtime make your own the game okay everybody else must stuff posted or else or else theyre going to get on posture in the house and theyre going to kill on the doubt theyre going to get killed and you know why because people really say that a...Full ReviewWhoever made it this is the best best of all time of oldtime make your own the game okay everybody else must stuff posted or else or else theyre going to get on posture in the house and theyre going to kill on the doubt theyre going to get killed and you know why because people really say that and their videos but youre saying that in the game because its its its its its an impostor versus crewmate right and in my right right right great great great great great great great great great
"I HATE THE NEE UPDATE DELETE IT I CANT SAY WHAT I HATE ABOUT THIS ITS ALOT MORE THAN U THINK MAKE THE CREWMATES ,  VOTING TABLET ,  CHATTING ,  AND THE OLD ANIMATION THE OLD LOOKS ,  EVERYTHING ITS SO UGLY MAKE IT LOOK WHAT THEY USED TO BE THE OLD ONE LOOKS 99999999X BETTER"
I am sorry about my review before. The reply has definetly changed the way i see the game. Its a fun game to play with friends.
Theyve made the game stupid. You cant reply custom text now. Also the gameplay is messy.
Its being very laggy and I had to uninstall it and then reinstall it a couple of times.
This game used to be so fun untill they ruined it with the talk system and the updates it is terrible dont get it
The app is really good but the reason I gave only four stars is because of the chat
The older version where you could chat normally was actually good. Look how they massacred the game 
"im really sorry but I really hate the new chat thingy because we cant say anything at all and its really anoying,  and im sorry but im deleting this app the new thingy on the chat is so bad"
I love this game until this disconnected from the server and saying 6 pings etc i just want to know how to solved this please
"This game was so fun but now is trash,  i cant chat or make a custom name without paying 0, 30,  thats so trash"
This games is really good the only thing i want is for it to start you with the option to choose what kind of text you want
This game is nice but i never become imposter and game should improve this thing and also who likes to be crewmate please  improve this thing please
"One of the best murder mystery games ever No ads,  easy controls,  good gameplay. TOP TEN BEST GAMES"
This game is terrible I was joining a game then I DISCONNECTED Then when I tried to join back I couldnt join for 15 MINUTES (DO NOT DOWNLOAD)
"90 of the time the game wont even connect,  even if its local"
VERY Good game but i dont like it when you need to choose your name and choose what you want to say at an emergensy meeting plzzz bring old among us back. COOL NEW MAP by the way
Too much ping Im getting disconnected often. Even though Ive highspeed WiFi.
This game is so beautiful. And this game characters color and hers hat is so funny . Install and play with funny . 
I very like this game.I played when I was small.You have crewmates and imposters.Crewmates do tasks and imposters kill and sabotage.
It always has the internet problem even though i have a good connectiom and when i get imposter it crashes
This game is fun but can you fix it i keep disconnecting even i have internet 5G but i keep disconnecting to pls fix that if you did that i would like to give 5 stars )
"Id honestly like to give it a zero,  since theres nothing to rate. My loading screen just goes on and on."
Fun but theres alot of bugs and hackers fix this problem Ill give it 5 stars
"The game used to be fun,  but the new update and removal of the chat feature ruined it"
This is very good. I am having fun playing this game. It has imposters and crewmates
The menu is ok and waiting in the lobby is ok but when the game start Im stuck at a black screen plz fix
THIS GAME SUCKS BECAUSE IT HAS A PAINFULLY slim change of getting imposter. Really disappointed in this game. Played it for 4 HOURS STRAIGHT AND NOT EVEN ONCE GOT IMPOSTER.. I almost forgot how to play as an Imposter...
Please change back to the old version where we can chat. This auto reaponse is so boring and not user friendly.
This game is perfect but There is a problem. I can not write anything but other can write plz solve this issue.
"this game is horrible you cant say what you want with the update and that is making me so mad What is wrong with that creators I know it sounds like Im overexagerating but its not,  I demand for them to change it or I am giving it a 1 star review"
Cool game.But i wish you add hide and seek kind of mode in game.
This game is like super fun. I just cant stop playing this game. And the new update made this game more fun. You can play it with 15 players now.
"I got a problem the problem is I cannot sign in and I cannot write, but the game is funny with your friends, but If you cannot write you cannot play it and if your name is a random name that is a very bad thing"
Among us please fix this because i went on this andit was loading forever to sign in my account and i uninstalled this to fix it but it said to download addisanl assets and i said install error
After the air ship map update i have not been able to play when i press public game the thing loads forever and its not my wifi
"So I love the game ,  but the update.. Im not a big fan of it ,  I need an app for naming myself ,  and I cant say alot of things to my friends if Im playing with them ,  I use to play it more before the update. Overall its a fine ,  good ,  game"
"I liked this game before update,  but now its very annoying and not opening also"
Firstly this a very bad game to play multiplayer. I always get disconnected. I hate this game so much. 
"I used to love among us.but now they removed messaging.so u cant say what you want to...but the animations are nice but.u cant say ___is sus, u have to say (a) is suspicious.and u cant say to your friends that u are so funny..bcaz in the game there isnt a column for that...."
Noob only this game before the update of this game it was my favorite game but now I had uninstall because after update too many bugs  and nothing
Guys cool down guys in the another update it was changed we can freely chat and no error while sign in .
The game is now getting real boring new maps and stuff is cool but same thing crewmate imposter no change......... Its sucks to be crewmate the most
Wow The best game and pls add more new task and new maps pls and make a modes that ypu can pick some mode and thank you
your game have a big bug that if we start the game it shows victory then again we then happen again so fix this bug ok and i gave you 3 stars
"Good game, tho I wish Imposters could have a separate chat in discussion and in game."
"I used to love this app but the update is ANNOYING I cant even change my name, hard to talk, AND EVRYTHING ABOUT THE UPDATE I HATE IT SO MUCH IM DELETING THE APP SO HOWEVER MADE THE NEW UPDATE I HATE YOU"
I love this game but i have 4 star because the buy a pet and more than need rupes please fix this problem
It is a good game but every time when a game starts the screen just goes black it doesnt start the game
Amazing game but one day i was about to play a game and once i pressed create game then my screen turned black...
I want This game to have a history area where u can see your past CREWMATES member who you used to play with and can message them in private and Can make a group FOR team work and personal purposes.
I really miss the old among us the one where you dont have to sign up it was all good in the old days
I like the game but pls in the next update remove accounts and make it so that we can choose whatever setting for a public lobby someones trying to find and also pls pls pls keep the messaging in emergency meetings or so on text it be highly appreciated thank you

"Cant play the game,  keeps saying Im disconnected from the server,  cant even host."
I like this game but I cant send messages in this game I will delete this game and install again it cant work.
Its cool i love this game the reason four stars is when you get killed you can still do tasks and that makes the imposter very mad so work on that please than ill update on it tommorow
It is so fun and exciting when you find out the imposter I really recommend this game
so good but it a littttle bad why because some time i could not join a game and it not fulll that one . Two can you do something about it .Thank you
I used to play this game everyday because this best game i have ever played. But sometimes there used to be some issues regarding the room. Still I like it .
"I love Among Us Its super fun being the impostor... Even though when I play for two hours I only get to be impostor twice P... Aside from that hehe,  I love to speedrun my tasks and then go to Security. Ive only been kicked out twice... Person below me..."

This game is awesome I like this game very much the reason I am giving it only 4 star because sometimes it doesnt work with room code so I am gonna cut 1 start for that
I used to love the original version and after the update its horrible I prefer the old chat version
Please please add back free chat Among us is boring without it just if people say cuss words just dont let them send it but dont take away a freedom to chat please also sorry for this review but the chat is just to much but other that it is a good game
"It was good when it became popular but with the newest updates coming in,  it meh now,  it is not as fun but still holds up "
This games ok but every time I play online it always disconnects Fix the disconnects please
"This game was good earlier but after updating,  it was boring. I wasnt able chat with the crewmates."

Pretty good game with a good team behind it. Simple and a fun way to pass time.
Excellent game l have played this with my freinds but there is a problem with chat can you fix it
I used to love this game before the update but after the update it was very confusing and difficult to play
The new colors seem bland and the new chat system is too complicated
I tried play the game and it didnt let me play it I tried being a creator of a server with 14 people and 3 impostor its said I needed a Among us account idk what it is but pls fix it played this game really long ago I used to play with my other account that had among us but now it doesnt let me ...Full ReviewI tried play the game and it didnt let me play it I tried being a creator of a server with 14 people and 3 impostor its said I needed a Among us account idk what it is but pls fix it played this game really long ago I used to play with my other account that had among us but now it doesnt let me play. Pls let me play the first time that happened I got mad cause when I tried playing it it just showed a black screen for no reason   I think it kinda unfair that it doesnt let me play i do.
Chat wasnt working but devs have fixed and added many things thank you Now we can use free chat
"I cannot even download it now from the same device I was using some months ago,  please fix this.........."
Nice game ... but most of the time my server get low and I left the  game.
I love this game so much but after all l dont like new updates l need real version hacker are every where lot of kid done how even play are every where it make it boring At least new map itl suck
"Rubbish update,  we cant even arite anything in the chat.. what the heck,  poor update."
I like the update but I dont like the fact that you cant rite a message or rite your own name so can you change does two things to normal tomorrow morning
Amazing. NEW updates are AWESOME. But you need to sign in for change name and Free chat
It was a good game the update brought many glitches and I cant chat please fix this
Hm its a good game but i cannot type at all And have glitches all the time i cannot play the game properly pls fix this
This is an amazing game but it was better when you could free chat
I like the old version better....it is very confusing on how you communicate and you cant even change your name
"Im lagging so much in among us it was all fine till the last update its not my cuz of my phone, please fix it if its a problem from the game, thanks"
I think it is fun but the chat is what is wrong I hate having to tap a button for what I have to say I like typing normally
This game is fantastic but there is a big problem and the is i cant type and I cant even change my name thats the problem just fix it and Im sure that time all give this game 55 rate ok
Terriable absaloutly terrible it has been suffering from a lot of server issues lately and it has very bad connection. Highly recommend you not to play this trash game
"As a developer,  its hard to make a game. But the only thing that I hate is the chat and the random username."
Its a fun game but I cant update it and I love 2 I just updated on April 2 and it went to 100 to 54 now 99 to 54 and I cant update it I think yeah I cant update it Heyy I cant play with my mom any more  can you please fix that the game said that I am fast chat and I want to play with my mom s...Full ReviewIts a fun game but I cant update it and I love 2 I just updated on April 2 and it went to 100 to 54 now 99 to 54 and I cant update it I think yeah I cant update it Heyy I cant play with my mom any more  can you please fix that the game said that I am fast chat and I want to play with my mom so can you please fix that I still love the game
Before it was So much interesting  and a fan of among usbut now  I dont like this much...coz of the update...we cant change name and send the imposter name...its hard to type ... need the old among us back pls 
Its pretty good and fun to play with but I do not like it that people dont ever talk they just vote random
I didnt like the update it upset me slot for an 8 yr old I quit playing it for 2 yrs finally download it and then I see all these hate comments I dont think I like it anymore Im a noob._.
the worst game worst worst worst it is not downloading additional assests or i cancel then the game starts and that is ok but when i join a game and it starts its just black screen for like 30 mins and then i quit the game and uninstall it
we need the free talk back but other then that it is a good game and kid friendly .
"I liked this game and even spent money in it but the new update made me wish I never did. Awful update and didnt help a thing,  I still get hackers and people swearing"
I really like this game the play style but one thing I feel bugged about U HAVE TO SIGN IN TO TALK FREELY like come on
"Why cant we chat with crewmates The new coating system is horrible  No 1 understands the other ,  voting is random"
I think the game is a great platform to play its safe fun also entertaining but until the new update came out its a 4
Will no longer let me sign in. When I click sign in it just freezes up. Please fix this.
Please allow user to change the position of joystick. Currently it is really not playable...
Players leave the game because they dont get the imposter role it happens in some matches which makes the game end quickly
After the update and all what you did the game started to be buggy... Its so trash i wish there was 5 stars so i could give it to you...
I gave 5 star before after the update it sucks I need a account to chat quick chat is soo hard and not user friendly please make it so we can talk without account and change username
"Superb game and it updated ,  airship map such a good map I love it Hey and the colour of updated are very good I cant tell how much I love this game"
"in new update has an issue so issue is sometimes while playing it show me dead body found again,  again  again non stop fix it plz"
This game is fun and this is also my favourite game but I dont like glitch and it is also easy game
the old version was wayyyyy better than the new one now i feel like im stuck i cant express what i saw or what i think its just become boring im this close to deleting the app (

This is fun the problem with the game now is gmail accounts because of that its really annoying cause everything I did was correct but you always declined. can you please remove that the update is getting on my nerves
Best game ever in my life but there is no need for an account.My friends cant sign in to this game but its playable)
This app keeps telling me to login to my account when I logged in like 20 times and then it says error.
Great game but I give it a 4 because you have to have an account to talk freely.
I enjoy among us but not the new update. This is only because i enjoy writing my own responses rather than have the game choose for me. The game itself was fine but now that it has the new update it just isnt very fun anymore. Sorry
I use to love this game so much but until the had a update and I was so happy but it was asking my e mail and I dont no how to play so I am so sorry but I have to delete this game and now it is my least favourite game so please  take out the e mail thingy so I can play this not only me but do eve...Full ReviewI use to love this game so much but until the had a update and I was so happy but it was asking my e mail and I dont no how to play so I am so sorry but I have to delete this game and now it is my least favourite game so please  take out the e mail thingy so I can play this not only me but do everyone dont like the e mail thingy so please take it out.
This game is fun but the creater ruined the game by adding a auto chat it is hard to serch words and it is very bad now . Pls take out the auto chat
The fuing game makes no sense anymore we cant chat people keep call ing unesry emergencies and every time u come out a game they say u cant play in five minutes the game sucks now
Its a great game no doubt but we cannot say anything we want can you fix this pls )
okay so i REALLY REALLY loved this game but somehow when i make an account it always say wait for the email to verify etc. but i never recieved one so i cant create an account I would really appreciate it if you explain how to create an account or atleast just fix it
Innersloth the pls remove that in chat you can only type what the game says you to and pls remove the setting in which you cant change your name to what you like overall it would deserve 5 stars but because of these problems its a 4 overall game is good
It was a great game but it got updated to Much... I cant say what u want I have to serch for place and person name... takes to long when in game
All I have to say about this game is  five stars fun game you can play free play and it has good reviews and its the best 
"I dont understand what yall saying. I mean,  I was using a guest acc. And the quick chat was optionable."
Because Im disconnecting me every time I get imposter and then it says you purposely disconnected and you cant play for 5 more minutes which is stupid
"Put back the old chatbox ,  the built in chat is horrible "
Love it but the making account thing has destroyed it since if your young you can only use quick chat (its not quick) so plss fix it
Three stars the old vers was pretty good but the update is the worst im sorry to give you guys 3 three stars(
Good game bugs but good bugs 1 hackers 2 not Abel to move 3 so some won reported a body 5 difrent reports flashed idk if its just the won time but...
I miss the free chat option it was so much easier to use
This game is awesome but why submerged map isnt comingI see a video trailer Among us new map This video says Submerged Among us in coming late July Now its late July.I wait a lot
This is such a fun game I havent experienced glitches so thats good.
"The only thing I dont like is the names. Before the big update we could use any name we wanted. Now we have to choose and pick. Bruh what the hell is Fishdub and Naivecrown ,  it was better when we could pick our own names."
"I dont really like the game anymore i used to play with my brother ALL THE TIME and now i cant chat my own way,  i cant have my own name,  its sometimes SUPER GLITCHY i dont like this game at all now pls turn it back the way it was inner sloth pls ("
This was a good game but the update ruined the chat and it became boring because the game ended so quickly
Best game ever but remove the accounts accounts are the worst remove accounts and the game will be fun but it is the the best game in the world  before acouts now no one likes it anymore because of acouts so remove them
i love this game its just that its harder to talk now i would love for the chat to go back to normal overall its still a good game
I used to love the game and play it with my friends but now you cant change your own name and talk or explain how you know who the imposter is i reloded it and it kept on kicking me and even if i went in my own server i disconect
Since the developers changed the chat function to not allow typing this game has gone downhill. Uninstalled.
Why I hate this game because its impossible to sign in I put in my email I cant login i check if I did my email right and I did can you fix this
Nice game but i have a problem. When i join a map that can join over 10 people
The new chat system is really annoying and difficult and also remove this auto naming system for guest players
"Hey,  so I of apologize for being rude,  but,  why do you have to sign up your guardians email,  what happens if you dont have a guardian,  and also,  I know why quick chat is here,  because of swearing,  Why couldnt you just make it like roblox so whenever you swear it does it like this  you"
They made it worse cause now u cant pick or us the chat normally .it only lets u pick a small veriaty or things to say
I am not able to play I dont understand why but when I click to find a match it says I cant. Even thought I have my data on.
The game is really good and fun to play. However I wish there was a friend requests and chatting for the impostors only
i like the game and all but add new close and hats so some of us can look more beter pls and make the close free so we can dress up pls.
It is great now. They finally fixed the chat problem. a real problem
"If you dont set up an email,  you cant speak freely anymore. It is overall a good game."
I enjoy playing this game alot and the best thing about it is when you become imposter But watch out you may get caught.
I give 4 stars because why are you deleting the typing area I was trying to type et the the box but the keybourd wont come out. PLS..... Fix this typing area amd I will give 5 stars.
This game is so fun you can even make friends from this game. All the characters look awesome.
I liked among until u did this update its to hadd to play now cause chats arent on and if u reported a body i cant say anything cause i cant find what i wajt to chat and they just voted me off cause i reported and didnt say anything we were happy when its not update the effort was to much im not pla...Full ReviewI liked among until u did this update its to hadd to play now cause chats arent on and if u reported a body i cant say anything cause i cant find what i wajt to chat and they just voted me off cause i reported and didnt say anything we were happy when its not update the effort was to much im not playing among us ajymore until u bring back the last among us that we used to play
I love this game but please fix the chat section i cant tell what i want to the game the choices of the words in the chat are few please fix it
You need to wait for 10 minites to play about after you disconnected of lefted alot of game.
I try to play the game but it keeps saying the i disconnected from the server and my network is good
I love this game and the idea but ill find the best of severs and get kicked out PLS FIX THIS (disconnected not banned or kicked)
"THIS IS A GREAT GAME, but a glich where while in the round we can still see the settings."
Game is really fun. But I have a hard time connecting to the server a lot of times.
Super fun but I wish there was more maps on the flame like custom maps and mods
"I rate 5 because i wanted to tell you that,  I vape. And also,  Pls make an update that Theres npcs who kills and sabotages ramdonly and the crewmate npcs go to their tasks and report dead bodies when near one."

Love to put on Spotify and play a few nosoundeffect games.
I am waited for the submerged map I downloaded at 3.8.2021 at sharp time 1146 but I opened and sign in and I dont see any submerged map pls realese soon
It used to be so fun but then when the game updated it became super boring cuz theres not as much freedom and i hate how you cant text in the chats or even change your name
"This game is great I havent discovered any bugs yet, awesome game"
Every time I join a lobby it kicks me out saying 6 pings that the remote has not responded to it rly makes me not want to play the game
Amazing the updates are cool and its fun to play but I dont like how the names are limited
I like this game but why we cant talk freely we need to option chat thats why I give the game 1 star
"Wow such a good game How fun killing people as an imposter i hope they add a new map ,  new roles,  and new modes"
The old things were good please allow to talk to other persons I am giving it 4 stars please allow old things that were there in the game
I prefer the old version where we could message ourselves the auto messages make it harder to communicate and then u dont say anything everyone thinks your it was a good game idk now lol
All game is nice but the chat system is too dumb because we cant explain what we want to said
I am giving four stars to get back the free chat without it I got mad to type and I need submerged map quick as soon after that changes I will give you five stars
i was loving it but there are many error of server kindly fix server error issue
The dev should include add friends so that players can invite their friends easily in the room their in.
This game was really fun. Though the game completely changed. I cant type anymore so I can barely explain myself if people accuse me. I also cant change my name which Is really annoying.

Keeps saying Ive disconnected from server. Cant even get started on the game
This is really cool and nice from me. I play with my friends together And I will kill my friend When I Imposter..But Now Chat is random Name Is Random...Well I will enjoy This Game...
Great game but after I updated I cannot participate in chat. I click but doesnt allow to type
The game is so cheap and it has very less sensitivity.I dont like this game a lot.
I do not like the new among Us I dont like how you cannot say what you want to say in the chat anymore you have to click something just to say it and I do not like this so I gave it a one star overall this is kind of a good game
When game start it always dark screen why and there is many bug please repair I so love this game
"It used to be really simple,  but now you cant choose a name and what you type."
The game is very nice but sometimes all of our Bodys report and all people left game pls pls fix the game overall among us is very good game .
This game is used to be fun but now its so boring. Its because of the quick chat
"All problems I had fixed by devs,  just sign in to account to get free chat access"

This is a fun game for friends with a lot of updates like new colors and new maps

This is a great game but the reason I gave it three stars is bc I hate the account text thing because I want to make friends but my phone wont let me sign so please fix the update please
The game is very nice but there is no any option to change name so that is the only problem every thing else is good
Personaly I like this game alot just they dont make me imposter thats why I dont like it alot means the game is awsome I will also ask that they do a separate mode of hide and seek this game would be amazing
It is nice but nothing changes likes skins or events are coming thats why I give only 3stars
This game so cool but theres a bug when i walk i was like fo out the map so pls fix it but im not use cheat thx..
Great game but most people have a problem with the chat also 99 of randoms are pretty dumb
Love the original version hate what they did with the chat I uninstalled 5 seconds after nowing I couldnt chat
This game is awesome but the thing is that I have to download to to chat with people that I dont know but its still fun
It is so awesome but when I join a game I get disconnected because of the ping  0 ms
I love this game but in update it is not allowing to do free chat if one is saying you are the imposter then we have to find the answer till we find the answer everyone has voted
I love this game and I have it on my phone Its amazing thank you for updating it I love the unicorn horn and then The colors I love it so much I love this game
The game is nice . But I always become crewmate not imposter. I played for 3 months I become only 5 times imposter.I had written in my book.
Its a really fun game just alot of disconnecting problems. I mean a lot.
"Its honestly a great game,  Im not one to leave reviews but there are waaay to much hackers and also its like im always crewmate"
Its so fun the only thing I would complain about is when I get on public the number never changes

I love this game Its really fun (when theres a good lobby) and its so fun when youre the impostor
It only lets me play local and wont let me play online worst update ever but it has more colors and new task so not the worst but still the worst update
I I didnt like this game now because I think that at the past it was much better now I cannot write what I want and I have to pick what you guys say and I think you guys have to change this update and change it back to the last update which was and Im on guest because right now I dont like it any...Full ReviewI I didnt like this game now because I think that at the past it was much better now I cannot write what I want and I have to pick what you guys say and I think you guys have to change this update and change it back to the last update which was and Im on guest because right now I dont like it anymore actually right in the past one I actually think that Im going to give it 10 out of 10 but right now Im giving it like a zero out of 10
"Cchange chat system,  old update chat was nice ,  so in next update change chat setting."
"I am 15 year old. But it still asks for guardians email and it shows error. Thus,  I cannot sign in. Fix this ASAP."
"Among us was my favorite game, but now its really bad I want the old among us back the update was not my type u cant even chat So pls fix it"
I would gave u a five star but I cant stand the pings like Im moving but it kicks me out everytime

I love this game like my fav but the quick chat pls fix it and its always dark when youre gonna start the game
Good game BUT it always kicks me out of the server and it is annoying
Good game they need more colors like coked brown and sun water and more
Make it how it used to be to where you dont have to sign in and I might get rid of the game witch I will  I also want to be able to chat normally
"This is great,  but there are some downsides too it,  like the chat,  but I respect that Innersloth wants clean chat. It can be annyoin though"
I liked this game a lot when I frist started playing it but now I HATE THE NEW VOTING SYSTEM please fix this.
I hate this game bruh u can change name u need quickchat to chat makes hard to type and u need randomize the name it sucks if i can put 0 stars i will do that all players are dissapointed on those updates is ruining the game all old players can be dissapointed on this update makes no fun when ur sus...Full ReviewI hate this game bruh u can change name u need quickchat to chat makes hard to type and u need randomize the name it sucks if i can put 0 stars i will do that all players are dissapointed on those updates is ruining the game all old players can be dissapointed on this update makes no fun when ur sus on some u an type fast quick chat make slow can u please remove quick chat and the name like u can type ur own name alot of players want name that they want those randomize is nonsense am i right
Cool game but the only think is that the updates are using too much storage and thats what make me rate it a 4
There are lots of problems it wont let me and my friends join as its to do with chat and quick chat and it wont let us play
I really liked this game before the uptate it was very fun but now it takes a lot of time to write by then people have already voted you out 
Umm I like it and all but there were 2 problems in among us first isyou cannot even chat properly and second is you cannot change your name properly too
Its really good but I hate it when people press the emergency button as soon as the game starts.
This game is very interesting. But can not Chat in free.
This game is fun even when your the Imposter this gamr is actually fun plus you can do tasks but i like crewmate a little bit but i love imposter more and i really like this game
"Why email now Now only quickchat INNERSLOTH...

YOUVE DOOMED YOUR GAME Now Everyone,  Play Minecraft and fortnite and gta 5 UNTIL This game fixes its bad update (maybe it will be good with nintendo switch accounts) Edit Nope You Still Need To Log In (Yes,  Even If You Have A Nintendo Switch Account)"
"Ez game game and happy game but Theres a problem,  The chat is broken so we need to chosse what are we going to say so please fix it on mobile )"
"This is really weird,  I tried to install it yesterday,  in here it says the app is installed but there is no app in the computer. Tried to search for it but no,  there is no Among Us on the computer."
"Among us is great but the game wont let me type in chat,  hope you guys fix this"
The latest update that doesnt allow players to chat is so worse.. Hope you would bring it back
I used to love this game until new update is kinda mad(the cleaning vents update) because when we kick someone it says the person left the game  so i might delete it for a bit for more apps 
I like this game when i was 9 year old but apparently The game was Crash i dont know what happen i try that again but its crash Again
"It keeps kicking me out before I can even get into the app,  I deleted it and re downloaded it and it still kicks me out"
Its amazing but the chat wheel is horrible. Take it off and do what roblox did.
New updates made the game bad and a black screen is there when i try to play bring back old among us.
BEFORE THE UPDATE THE GAME WAS ALL RIGHT BUT NOW GAME NEVER STARTS AND AMONG US HAVE COUNTLESS BUGS. PLEASE FIX THESE BUGS
Every time I try to play its always been packet wasnt acknowledge.Tried of it now
I LIKED THIS GAME VERY MUCH BUT THERE IS A PROBLEM THAT I HAVE PLAYED MORE THAN 10 ROUNDS BUT NOT EVEN A SINGLE TIME I WAS AN IMPOSTER ALSO IN THE NEW UPDATE WE CANT TYPE SO WE CANNOT SAY EVERY THING WHAT WE WANT
"The game used to be so good until the new update. Its just a terrible game now all the fun its gone, just terrible."
I love this game i would give it five stars if you just got rid of quick chat.
I like it but names sus you out asap. And people dont belive anything you say of you have a name like Something Fang. Also make some tasks more understandable some are like WHAT DO I DO Also sometimes you are kicked for no reson.
"I really love this game,  but there is too much hackers that hacked the games that players cant play the game ("
Everytime I join the lobby it takes me back saying error or server I cant play at all FIX IT plz
REALLY cool game but pls remove in the chat were u always click not tipe freely and i found a bug that the vission glitches all dark
"This is a garbage I cannot add my friends and it is really glitche there are a lot of hackers so,  I give it one star"
Me give 3 starts i am play this game but host start the game so my android screen and stuck please fix this problem fix among us black screen 
Nor bad but after the new update it is fun to play but some times when it lags up I only see black screen
The reason I gave this 3 stars was because of the new chat thing I would give it 5 stars if it was the old chat
THE GAME IS GOOD AT ALL BUT THE CHAT OPTION IS WRONG BEFORE UPDATE WE CAN TYPE ANYTHING AND MAKE STRATEGY.
Bugs bugs  bugs. I am not unintentionally disconnected. You blocked me for 5 mins not to play.
I love this game I can play with my friends but I have problem when I sign in but nothing happens
My net is full but still it is disconnecting me when I am imposter in crew that not fix it..
Among us needs to stop dissconnceting people and then not let someone play for a certin amount of time after dissconnecting because of a network issue.
Nice game and please add special roles like jester medic giant sheriff etc that would be more fun and we need the submerged map
it is a good game after all but i would like to be imposter more but i like this games i played it alot of time with my self and my friends.
"Omg I LOVE this gameI love everything about it The skins are realy cool and the hats AND the pets Innersloth, your the best Cant wait for the new mapEditOMG I LOVE THE NEW FETURESThis game is awesome"
I loved the game before but now that you cant choose your name without a parents email and stuff it sucks I can even tell 0eople where I was sometimes
I actually like it sometimes it crashes but its still really good I rate it 5 stars
Its an cool  And even my words are small to this man..... Im awful with this game but............. It never and ever give me an chance to becomes imposter in online playing ...........so this games rate 4 star babe
The game will not work for me every time it starts it will log out
"New chat feature ruined it. The only reason the game was famous was cuz of the Free chat. Its gone now,  so am I. Bye"
"Fun,  but the community is garbage. Everyone is 12 years old and stupid."
Goood it was so fun but i cant get free pet and free skin if innersloth give it and i will rate 5 stars
great game used to be a lot of glitches and quickchat is optional now so 5 star
"among us used to be fun,  now its full of brain dead cheaters that the game didnt do anything about them,  ruin the experience for me"
"I used to love this game,  but now I cant change my name to what I want it to be,  and I cant chat This is the most stupid update ever WHAT THE HECK INNERSLOTH"
Great game. But every time i leave the game like x3 it says im banned for 5 minutes plz fix that
Get the old chat back im angry on the new update cause the chat is so annoying if you wanna 5 stars get the old chat back
I gave it three stars because i hate the new update it is so annoying how u cant actually type in the chat and u cant choose ur own name and its sooooo annoying
I like the game but the reason that you have to do an email something you guys are not verifying and the games to be so much fun but now that thing that you guys are doing is not fun
Ive got an idea for the game to get even better by using friend request a new map and free pets.
Thank you for removing bugs and for work on graphics but please add some good hats and skins like among us pc version
You cant type anymore and you cant do stuff without signing into a account. Its just not he same anymore
Best game ever I play it with my brother and sisters at times when I dont have anything to do this game is awesome please make more like this one
"please fix your damn servers. this game is great,  but due to the bad servers I cant enjoy it. please for the love of God fix it"
"Please let us have to chat, not fast chat.. we even cant chat like the old version one.. please get the chat system back.."
I love it but its kinda out of hand.see is was good with the chat but now its bad like comon change it back to normal
Unable to play. Diconnected from the server error every time.
I love this game it has a way you can play offline and you can play online with your friends 
I really used to play this game with my friends but in the new update there is a lot of boring this like i want to right my name EVERY ONE HAVE TO RANDOM THERE NAME AND THEY GET STUPID NAME LIKE DOG HEAD  2 why cant i write what i want why should i say silly things Like (_____)killed(_____)...Full ReviewI really used to play this game with my friends but in the new update there is a lot of boring this like i want to right my name EVERY ONE HAVE TO RANDOM THERE NAME AND THEY GET STUPID NAME LIKE DOG HEAD  2 why cant i write what i want why should i say silly things Like (_____)killed(_____) Ugh if you didnt fix it this game will die thankes for your time
"It was Nice App,  when i try to Play it says 5 Minutes it take While.."
Game is good but my bother will play but we will be add someone so not added many times my will do but not happen thats why I give you 5 star please fix it
Its really hard to chat on a Android tablet you cant change it or at least I cant other than that this games the best
Nice and fun game i wish there was a light purple or lavender color 
"Last 7 games I played,  red was the imposter and it was not different Games. It was the same game started again after winning"
So I like the new map and new tasks and the new colors you can choose but u cant write what u want any more its annoying u know cause when u wanna write something and they have it it gets annoying
Its fine but I miss where u can type what ever u want. The old among us was better. A little bit.
It gets boring over time and before it says Shhhhhhh and tells you what team your on Its black for a while so 2 people have already left by the time it starts
The game is good but it wont allow you to choose your own name or words and it sucks can u fix it Its annoying
When they first got the game out I was obsessed but now they wrecked the game with a new update I dont like it anymore youtubers have stopped playing this game because the update pls turn it back we liked the old style.
Its a fun game but I dont like how you cannot use the chat anymore and say what you actually wanna say
I like how you add details and the killing animations keep it up.
Just A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. thats all i have to say  back in 2019.

Now the update with auto chat sucks  u cant explain anything properly and it takes a minute to form a sentence which by the time everyone has already accused and voted u off. Like wth I can see the purpose of this chat update but it really doesnt improve the game one bit. Maybe put a report button for players if one is not playing properly beside messing with the chat.
Overall this game is so good but there some problem that game start very late and I didnt write messages by myself wanna this game is amazing to play with cousin and friends 
it does not even open for me so i have decided to reinstall it. And in fist it ask me of accept i clicked it but it was not opening so pls fix it
"Thank you for updating the game, I like the vent cleaning task I just dont like when their showing us which vent. I dont know if this is a mod but on YouTube I saw a new map on among us named sumbered,  I think, can you put it early please I will really appreciate it"
One of the best games.But it also needs some improvements such as more maps etc.
Its very creative but theres to many hackers and I really cant use the actual chat
The app doesnt even reach the loading screen anymore before crashing EVEN after the update.
Its a very nice game of teamwork and betrayal which should be played with friends
Now that they added the new update so you can have 15 players its a better app because now Im rid of quick chat yay
Its fun and I enjoy it but the chat function is really annoying and I cant say anything I wanna say.
I use to play this game when Im seven I usually play with my cousin but things are so lagging all the time but I still like it at least I get to play with it and have fun and Im a expert on among us
I HATE the new updates i dont like that they make u sign in and if u make a guest account they randomize ur name I liked among us before this update Even though it used to crash
"Very good game,  the problem is that it changes settings sometimes automatically"
Its pretty darn good cause all of those new colors and stuff n new map and that easter egg like henry stick man but problem is i cant chat... It sooooooo weird ....
I used to like this game alot but now I keep getting voted of cuz of the chat system pls bring back the old among us it was so much fun
Theres a bug where i report a body it glitches the screen where you vote. i wish you guys can fix this.
"Welcome To Among Us,  Im a Ex Beta Tester,  If u put on free or quick chat,  lots of server that are not for gaming will apeear,  so stay on quick chat"
The game is really fun but it has a con. Quick chat is really stressful my brother has quick chat and he keeps saying. I wish among us removed quick chat So please remove this Innersloth
Once again I have to give yall 1 star this update is terrible I want to type what I want instead of clicking a lot of buttons Im never downloading this game again yall deserve 3.6 stars 
Excellent because animation good And 4 maps for play . Dadicated for Continuous support.
Its good but... quick chat... but we also have free chat (which Im more use to). k49 is rigged.
The chat is really ridiculous and I cant even choose my name... this game used to be fun but now with all of this changes its just become boring
I cant even login it doesnt even send me an email to log in I have tried it multiple times
Tf this update We want previous version back The photo chat system sucks And im regretting installing this app.
Its fun but now its no fun please ger rid of the chat commands and chat freely
I really like this game ) i hope an add friend feature comes soon btw can you add a favourite friends list
I use to like this game but because of the update that we cant say what we want to say anymore so i dont play among us that much because of the update so please fix this
I used to love this game but because of the update I lost my love in it but now the old among us is back and I love it. Thank you for bringing the old among us in my life.
I love this game but I have to give you only 4 stars because I want a special update in among us and that update is that we can change speed in freeplay mode I want this update ok among us innersloth and after this update I will be give you 5 stars ok innersloth
This game is laggy and when iam playing that says connection lost my connection strong
I love it the first day I did not know how to play. i rate it 1010 game and Im now a pro and I win as an imposter and I love the new map I really really love the flying platformer and love the ladder in among us thank you innersloth for the new map.
I would have given this all stars if the Creator didnt delete the second version if that doesnt happen in 5 years then theyre the worst game makers ever
Sooo the reason why i gave it 2 stars. its bc of the update. i dont really mind the maps and hats and colors and all of that stuff but why in the world do you need an email 
I like the game but there is a problem i cant customise my name please fix this issue if you fix this issue i will rate this app 5 stars but for now it will be 4 so please fix the issue so I can rate this app 5 stars.
Theres this problem that people on Android cant sign in please can you try to fix this
Ok not bad but when I play in freeplay I finish all task but it doesnt say I finished please fix the bug soon
There is a problem in the new update When the game started the screen still black i cant see anything although i can hear the voting sounds How can i solve this problem
"FIX YOUR GAME,  ITS NOT LETTING ME CHANGE TO QUICK CHAT OR FREE CHAT,  IF THIS IS A REGULAR FEATURE TO NOT LET IT CHANGE,  THEN REMOVE IT I CANT JOIN MY FRIENDS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT OPTION"
I like this game but I have one problem is net work connection i have net but it not working properly game
I like this update but what i dont like is that you dont really type there anymore like im not used to just putting words and figuring it out at least bring back typing im olso using this in phone. And it makes it not fun. (
I love it but the bug is that loads for long time i waited almost 2 hours still takes long plss fix it
Among Us is a very fine game but its the fact that I have to give them my email to have free chat. Can you please put back how the way it was Thank you
They changed it so much so you cant type in chat and makes it so much harder
The reason why Im giving birth at three out of five is because of my keyboard on my phone is taking way too long to load and then a lot of people think Im suspicious but then actual reason is that Im waiting for my keyboard to pop up so can you please fix it
This game is amazing because its super fun with some new updates like the airship and the new vent cleaning task and I love getting imposter hehe Thanks innersloth
I like this game but update you did was terrible we cant write anything the quick chat is actually slow chat
Would be great to play if it was possible to play over mobile data. Fix this please.
why do you have to sign in now it use to just be change name join game and free chat but now you have to do so much stuff this game is trash I HATE INNTER sloth THIS DOESNT DERIVE A. 5 STAR OR A 4 OR 3 OR 2
Fun easy to follow but challenging games to play with family or friends
It was perfect for me and my family you can interact with other people and you friends.
Once i heard about among us i decided to give it a try i know that quick chat is made for safety and to make sure nobody says inapropiate or swear words but quick chat is very frustaing to use forreal among us dont feel like among us no more with quick chat i mean you could just like block some wor...Full ReviewOnce i heard about among us i decided to give it a try i know that quick chat is made for safety and to make sure nobody says inapropiate or swear words but quick chat is very frustaing to use forreal among us dont feel like among us no more with quick chat i mean you could just like block some words that are bad but quick chat its just not fun sorry just block the chat like when a player says something bad then just censor it like add dots i miss typing messages like questions please
Used to love this game but taking away chat is stupid hopefully you read feedback and fix it
After update this is the worse game ever always telling network issue but there is not network issue hate it 
This is a good game but there should be some diffrent and new tasks and a new map
Oh my god Why did you guys get ride of chat Its just awful  to play Its difficult to communicate and convey answers Please get it back
Its fun to play with friends and the controls are easy
Everything is good but the feedback I want to give is I cant type anything myself please fix this. (
"In the quickchat Im not able see names of people who are in new colours,  when it is deciding to be a crewmate or imposter the becomes black  Sometimes when I join a lobby everthing is black which came again everything is black a game in free play ."
Good and after this update crewmates are spending more time to do the tasks. And its being easy for impostors to kill 
The game is cool but the chat is so bad idk why they do that I think because they dont what to say bad words or just chat hsh shanks somethink that no word is
All you have to do is stop random names and its perfect account system is neat just add friends list thats all 910
"They need to change so you could freely chat,  so they wont vote you off all the time i like I have been"
I did not even get to play this game because of how long it takes to load but it is still a fun game. But if u are not online it is really boring
This game got a bit worse it chat please fix it make it the better old chat
I was a big fan of this game but after this update this all seems to taken away all yhe fun.Now this game is the worsest game in my whole life.This is a in game. Pleaee dont download it.
I play on a galaxy s7 and never get imposter and cant update where all my ohter games are the lates version please fix soon this game was fun now its SOOO and the new map is compileted and bad 
"I want a Novisor map if you don, t what that is right on the you tube gametoons novisor and you will now what i am talking about please create the replacement of the imposters"
"Game is very nice ,  Its best game for me but FIX THE GLITCHES ,  AND RESTRICT. HACKERS WHICH RUIN THE GAME"
This app is berry good I loved it but there is one thing I am hating that in amoung us that we cant write anything please update it that we can write
"This game has lost its fun ,  too much cheaters and hackers in every matchgameroom,  they made this game horrible ,  Please fix this"
I love this game this game but very time i disconnected from the server please fix this
Great game i think they should make the chat normal again though.
I try to join game the games show me the there are more games so I try to host but game show me there too many games try to join any game instead please fix this bug
In 2020 I was loving it but when at sometime in 2021 I couldnt type what ever I wanted its soooooo confusing how to type just one word
Still cant create an account to get freechat. Keep getting the googleauthnotoken error.
Lots of bugs when I try to play it so slow Please FIX YOUR GAME
It is a fun game. but it gets glitchy overall it is a good game.
This game is like the best game in the world but I wish You can type again so sad hopefully it comes back
Great game but I always get disconnected. 
I like it but it but someone could get inposter 10 times in a row and get inposter 0 times
Last time I gave one star because of quickchat but I am really impressed with new update and I have reinstalled this game. ^_^
Was much better before they changed the key board and name choices. Please change it back 
Already update. Is there any options for the joystick to be on the right side. Please consider the setting again. Thank you.
My first 20 games played I never became imposter wich is the only reason anyone plays this game so now u know why no one plays it anymore and the creators of it are too stupid to have a different perso as imposter
This update is great Also bad liars would be like I was cleaning the vent its a new featuretask well now vent cleaning is a thing  also free chat is back so... LETS GO Also Polus WAS the biggest map but now since the Airship is here it takes the crown for the biggest map ingame
This game is worth a fortune but the reason i gave it three stars is because when i enter the game it says disconected from server
It has no ads and fun free game to play with others online have fun with your friend
the game always lock me out of the game. they ask me to send 6 pings. what pings annoyed me so much
The game was fun at first but with all the new updates and new settings it is just not fun anymore
This game allways kicks me off.... But othere wize it is a fun game to play....

its a really good game and its fun but the new chat update make it kinda boring and theres not much to say
"The game is good,  but here is why I give it 4 stars THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IS SO FKING TRASH  YOU CANT EVEN TYPE ANYMORE PLEASE,  bring typing back and I will give it 5 stars"
The new update ruined the game by removing the classic animations and adding too many players and similar colors
Hey your just lost the bet I liked this game but now its not enjoyable please cut out the account and free chat things beacuse its annoying and please go to the older version please
Theyve ruind it I think that since theyve added the new updates it takes peoples freedom away to speak I have uninstalled it because it is no where near as good as the old version and if they keep it like this is never will be
"Before the update, it was so easy to communicate in chat.But now very hard.Plz return the old chat"
"Only one word....masterpiece. This game will be marked down in history....it will be like Minecraft, legends of zelda, any game with Mario that is old, call of duty, every game that is popular.

Earlier it was so good but now its so boring nd complicated to msg ... Bakwas game ever  . Dont waste ur time by installing this 
Taking away the chat is the death of this game. Absolutely pointless. Rot in hell Among us
I was in the game i saw some one vent but the chat did not have some one So please Return the Chat how it was Before and i love the new Colors
Can i ask when androids get their update too I cant join any games because i dont have the newest update and i dont see the option. Even uninstalled and reinstalled. 3 its alright but i hope it gets updated soon )
It an amazing game I enjoyed playing with my friends we had alot of fun. Thank you for created this game
I dont like the new version I like the first but I like the vent clean but u cant say anything in chat and talk to friends or make your own name
My chat will not bring up my keyboard to type... frustrating I like the new updates to the game play though...
I cant even play because you have to put your bank card details in this game. Please fix this and make the game better
Good game but its asking for my guardians email for to free chat. And i gave my guardians email and my guardian gave permission but its saying that wait for ur guardian to give permission (
This is the best game but the chatting is one fing I dont like at all but mostly ok I going to give it 555 stars
Mest up game cant enter code me and my dad last tow weeks and this comes up incorrect chat mode this room was made for chat or quickchat your setting is quickchat only
Pls add a little update that we can add friends and we can know that are friends are online or offline pls add these new feature pls answer me and these is very good I like this game very very so much bie
Dont know why but Im not able to type somthing in the chat box why My device is galaxy Note 9
"Its ssooooooooooo nice i really love this game, its past me,  this game after a update its not even loading."
I used to enjoy the game but the new chat feature sucks. Seriously sucks.
"This game is horrible. (My opinion) So first,  you cant chose your own name anymore. And you basically cant chat anymore without being 13. If our parentsguardians think were responsible enough for a phone,  Im pretty sure were responsible enough to chat."
"Why I cant send any messages Why another players always vote me but I am crewmate Why another player hacked me Urghh,  please fix it  I cant play this app again,  so bored and not useless "
Whats up with this game it keeps disconnecting every time am in a public server
Nice until the chat update  it messed up chatting it takes time to explain who is impo and other things
I love the game but I cant play with my friends now so I give it one star I used to love the game so Inner sloth pls get rid of this update it is annoying. And I really want to play with my friends 
Its is a good game but there is a problem of pings
App keeps crashing when we aren playing hide and seek first it disconnected and then phone died AND THENY PHONE DISCONNECTED AGAIN FIX THIS NOW
Hay among us I love your game but there is a small problem when I played your game it says error when I start a server can you help me.
I like the game but i hate sign in can we chat for free thats why i just rate 3 stars and 1 thing i want to change my name for free not random
The Game Is Fun But The Bugs Are Super Annoying Sometimes The Game Crash Ones You Play Public
Is a very good game very fun if you cant read or write its not fun you can find a server or nothing
"The game is very nice and I like the game,  mad also the controls are very easy Edit Amogus"
I think every 3 months they should update the game so we wont get bored playing it

Its a great game But theres some bugs...but other than that its awesome

I like before chat after chat is so annoying and find what I want to say. The team is voted but I finding word this is bad for orther
Its 1 year ago when I check this app and I got a long update but its ok but the problem 1 the quick chat
"I used to have among us when i was 9 and it was amazing,  buti kinda restart my phone so it was deleted then now i download it back but when i started the game all i see is black color and i cant play it like really,  so please fix this problem of mine..."
Ok so u can login and chat but was it needed Just made it harder to use still there are some good lobbies Need a add friend feature so that finding good lobbies is easier
Honestly all of my friends recommend this game to me and told me it is really very nice but I have had this game for days now and I am not able to play it it shows me that I have to download some updates and when I accept it then it doesnt download .

Will I be able to play this game in this life or do I have to take rebirth to play it  really disappointed
It is good to play it on a phone but not on a tablet because my tablet lag in the game when it starts
Just play it . Its fun. Take the time to get to know the controls down its worth playing
Soooo sooo bad settings in free chat and quick chat poor app I think the management of this app is gone mad they dont know what to do so please check your app then launch on Play Store and it also waste my time 
It is a little laging and it kicks you out of most when it does not kick you out it is really fun
When I started playing this game I was like its fun new update ruined everything I hated the update so much that I deleted the game and nothing works among us if you see this bring it back to normal
I have installed this game again and honestly. A shadow of its old self but better than the shell it was when the Airship came out.
I cant play because when a game starts its just a black screen but otherwise an amazing game
Nice game but since we can play with 15 people its hard to become imposter so plz remove this feature
Very Nice game It is also a family friendly game and it can relax you after doing work
Its stupid that you have to have an email to have free chat and have a free name too the game will be much better if you got rid of that
Its a great game but maybe work on filtering out other bad things
I used to love this now I hate the update and my brother downloaded this its not opening all we see is pink background fix this. Atleast do it right.
"Very great game,  love it and I could play it all day i recommend among us to whoever sees this review."
"This is great,  really great but you updated it,  I not able to chat why I cant comment its brown they pick me,  I saw brown vent,  Why Suck game "
I really love this game its really helpful and its like being a imposter and a crew mate is easy and thank u for this game its very helpful
Best game ever I get to play with friends and stuff is a fun game no bugs one task I like is clean vent get to prank your friends is u clean the vent have a nice day
I like game bc it fun but I do have 1 complaint I cant get in a game ( thats it tho overall great game)
The chat is so annoying and the most annoying thing is that we cannot write our name I play it with my friend but it is hard to figure out who is who so please fix it
This game sucks because I feel offended that this game is so bad and my friend is a burnt chicken nugget and we just wanted to play a game of among us but the only thing that was stopping us is the trash game mechanics and this is exactly why your game is dying so go play Fortnite or Minecraft maybe...Full ReviewThis game sucks because I feel offended that this game is so bad and my friend is a burnt chicken nugget and we just wanted to play a game of among us but the only thing that was stopping us is the trash game mechanics and this is exactly why your game is dying so go play Fortnite or Minecraft maybe even Roblox because anything is better than this garage garbage.
Among us is the best game of 2020 but it glitches many times so I give it a four star.
Match making is too slow and after from space ship it take too long to enter in game
Best game but when we join a 1imposter lobby then host can change the number of imposter SO PLZZZZ FIX THIS
I will give 5 stars a good game and all but atleast give us an option to change the chat settings and to choose our own name
"Games is great now. I can now create an account and chat with others,  thanks for the update"
The game was many bugs and big problem are the game was not sign in PLZZ fix this issue
You disconnect every time you load into a game but it is very fun on the other hand
The app. sucks after the new update constantly kicking players out and black screens.
finally u fixed the quick chat thnx but there is something I want to tell u when u minimize your screen and go back it disconnects u please can u fix this
Please remove the new update i hate it crew doesnt take it seriously when you type i really love the old among us it was simple and nice . Let us type in chat and voice chat make its worse. Please remove the new update
Now on a laptop you can only see pink bloobs and its bothering me. I tried to redownload and its not working. Also now you cant choose your name. Like one of my first names was meancroud. PLEAZE FIX.
This game was awsome. What happend Controls are so bad new tasks are bad evrything is bad.
its so hard to play on laptop if i play from keypad your game is loding on bluestak and it cannot be played in bluestak 5 i hated this game on laptop
Its harder because you cant write things that you want to write and even if people write stuff I think you should switch it back
"Worlds best game I have ever seen.but I only give it 4 stars because there is no events in the game and when we won a events we will get a hat, pet or a skin as a gift so please in the next update please add what I have commemted"
Awesome gaming for whole family and friends to chat and play with fun and everyone enjoys it.
The game is really fun but pls pls plsss make an update where you can add friends in it I have made a lot of friends in among us but its so sad that we cant met each other again (
I like playing but know its just super laggy and I bought a pet but after I updated the game I lost it
The game is fun. But everyone says bad words. Everyone has in appropriate names. For example someone was called cocsucka. I liked this game. But it got ruined.
I like the game because it gets updated so much but I dont like that people cant join when there is an update but other then that the game is pretty awesome
Okay I like this game but please we Indonesia kids cant speak english so we can typing in game because cant speak english so PLEASEBACK AMONG US LIKE 2020
I love this game but the new updated was cool but the stupid quick chat please fix it Im the only person who has the stupid quick chat
Why are you guys requiring accounts created on your own platform Thats ridiculous cause otherwise we cant join the lobby that has free chat enabled.
I love the game but I cant type on my own so it terrible and hard to find the answer to say so I hope you fix this
So i live the game but the reason I gave it 4 stars is because quickchat sucks o want free chat cuz one time I saw the impostor vent and I called a meeting g and it was only 15 seconds long and I had to find the impostors name but I couldnt and everyone voted me and we lost if quickchat hadnt bee...Full ReviewSo i live the game but the reason I gave it 4 stars is because quickchat sucks o want free chat cuz one time I saw the impostor vent and I called a meeting g and it was only 15 seconds long and I had to find the impostors name but I couldnt and everyone voted me and we lost if quickchat hadnt been added I would have said I saw orange vent so please remove quickchat
the game is pretty fun to play but there is something i dont like 1.why we cant write our username bye our self but username that you make it 2.why we cant chat with our own writing but use your word that u made plz fix it i miss the old among us
Best game ever the thing is we cannot type while chatting we have to choose what to say so 4 stars lol
Awesome game one of my Fav only thing is recent update has a huge lag time and keeps crashing
Its a very good game but now we cant message ourselves and we cant change our names that is so irritating please make it like old among us llwhere we could chat and write our own name
Edit i fixed it had to make a NEW account i still have my old one i use my old one and use the sdocnd one i made for only among us its staying at two cause of the hassle you need to fix this so it doesnt happen to other people
Really like this game but pls remove The Auto chat feature cos its annoying Pls remove it or else this game deserves 5 star
Sorry I was hard headed but you need an account inorder for you can type in the game wow I didnt know sorry creator of among us I loved your game since 2018 and still.
The auto chat sucks we cant explain things clearly please bring back free chat feature
it is a great game but it needs to be able to connect to Bluetooth keyboards
I like the game by the way this is kids game and more people thought they can put bad words in the name tags and chat they thought this was a adult game this was a kid game.
"There are too much bug and too much hacker.You all did a success in gaming industry.But no optimization, no development.Why dude... Among us my favourite online game but you all make it a joke..."
This game is so glichi I cant play a single match the game always close on its own that is so annoying I hate this plz fix it 
Its very cool until among us update the chat. pls bring back the old thing with chat because its easier to control
Im giving you 1 star because I miss the old among us when I could play with my sister but she cant have an account so she cant play with me can we just remove accounts or 10 year old have them pls I miss old among us.
Its fun but whenever I want to make my own lobby it wont let me and I keep getting disconnected
I love the game but some times it is Dark and miss quick chat and now it looks so excellent
Its just an amazing application. There are no add in this game . The best part of this game was conversation.
This game was great. But. The creaters ruined it by adding quick chat it removed the social part of the game and you cant swear YOU CANT SWEAR
This 1 Supposed To Be Our Fav Game When It Was Realeased But We Got Bored And Starting To Dislike The Game All Of Our Friends Play This But We Got So Bored And Trying To Get A New Game Bc This Was Kinda Boring now.
Even the update wont help among us wont load up 5star to 1 listen to my comment pl among us wont load it sent me to home screen fix the problem
The best spacemgame is this and I miss when u can type freely not like when u have to rest buttons to talk
I used to like it but the chat option makes it tough to explain more specific things
Game used to be great. Updates have bricked multiplayer. Garbage now.
"This is Fun Game But Here are too Glitch and Lag. So,  I dont like This Game. And Sometime My cursor was freezed.So Bad Game Plz Dont Download"
Love it Wish I got into it way sooner. Watching CallMeKevins videos on YouTube is what made me try it and Im not disappointed. )
I like this game but the app stopped working I cant even play the game anymore I deleted the app an downloaded it again an it still dont work this is very frustrating
It has the best graphics avalible and its just flat out awsome
Good game Needs an update in which you can add friends Great playing with friends if you have any Love killing crew when im imposter
this new actualization is so fuked up. i hate it so much. Among us was way better without this weird pickawordboard and wothout random generated names ] i know the purposes of this but its trashy and unplayable
Literally cant play. Whenever I click Find Game it loads forever.
This is so Great  I can play with my friends or play by myself but so many glitches
This a very nice game I play all the time but in new updateyou removed the free chat so pls put it back pls.
I like the game but the update i did not like and i hope you will change it for us and i heard there a new map in the water good luck with that
The Quick chat is sooooooo annoying innersloth. Look at all the comments nobody likes the game anymore. I know your trying to be safe and blah blah blah but thats not fun. Please change the game back. Everybody HATES among us now. Please listen to me and respond 
Update makes me want to cry. No room for creativity. All preset chat. Sucks.
Can you make sure that the game music  is very creepy and is not a horror game
Hey innersloth pls add like a friend reqeuest in the settings you can see how much ppl you can friend like if theres one person you can friend them in the settings and you can join their server or if they joinend a different server you can tp to them and see if they are online or not and add like a...Full ReviewHey innersloth pls add like a friend reqeuest in the settings you can see how much ppl you can friend like if theres one person you can friend them in the settings and you can join their server or if they joinend a different server you can tp to them and see if they are online or not and add like a server search when you want to join the same server put the name and it will find the server add that to pls

I love Among Us it is fun I get to play with my friends on among chat and it is not annoying because I need you guys to do an update and I finally see the airship
My game is very still crashing so Im mad and then Im not gonna play amongus thats why Im giving it a onestar if my game didnt crush that I would have believed it left to die five star Eunice love you need to fix amongus right now Im not giving it a 5star rating
I cant type in the chat or like anything its so annoying and when I try to say something I always get voted out
Horrible just horrible. This was the best game ever but now it looks like to is made out of po. Sorry guys but have to make it better especially the chat. Let us talk freely
The new update is hard to use and extremely stupid. It was much easier to use before the new update.
"In this game,  I cant be imposter always being crewmate . In a day,  I even cant get imposter . But why and also please release submerged map in among us."
I dont really like the update where u have to have a profile to chat. Not fun anymore its so complicated
Heyy I love this ofc but mid match my screen keeps going black please fix that
I really used to like this game but ever since they added the quick chat feature I hate this game sooooo much 
OK so I dont know about this new update because I just started to update my game but I hope its worth it because I have saw a lot of bad reviews on this new update and not only that but I also love this game so I hope this new update wont ruin my favorite game for me.
"before update i can use my bluetooth keyboard,  but after the update i cant even move using my keyboard."
Please add voice chat that would be cool but make it to ware you can mute yourself in the voting deal and the dropship
"I really loved this game before all if the updates because I could type what I want to say and tbh it makes the game dry, so because of that I cant play skeld.ned anymore because I cant type the game MOD thingy And can yall please make that we can customize our name and not just randomize it because...Full ReviewI really loved this game before all if the updates because I could type what I want to say and tbh it makes the game dry, so because of that I cant play skeld.ned anymore because I cant type the game MOD thingy And can yall please make that we can customize our name and not just randomize it because the names that yall give us to use dont make senseAnd PLEASE add a free pet for the kids whos parents dont want to pay for it and a skin for free we will find it MUCH more fun if u change it"
The game is horrendous now PEOPLE KEEP THINKING ITS PEOPLE THATS IT NOT BECAUSE WE CANT GIVE EXPLAINATIONS NOW ITS HORRIBBLE ITS SO HARD TO FIND WAYS TO EXPLAIN TO I HATE IT DEFINETLY DELETING SOON
Good game even though it has memes about it and it didnt have adds Because I dont like adds.
U guys changed the update And added more skin colors (or whatever u call that) I love this game sm pls dont change the update I think this will be my favorite game from now on
"This update sucks, every time i join a game and it starts its a black screen the whole time, i wish u never invented this damn update"
"I really like it its fun and noice,  but I only give it 3 stars because I have to put an email and I can never remember mine c"
I hate the new chat . But some how I fixed it either way I think well I mean I KNOW that among us should change there chat.
I dont really want to play among Us well I do want to play but every time I play theres no server for me it always says youve been disconnected from the server what does that mean
Every time I try to join a game it keeps disconnecting me for no reason
Weird because when i try to host a game its black and when I try to go to other people game bwt they was taking a long time
Among us is a fun game were there 3 or less imposter and lots of crew the crew job is get the imposter out and do all tacks the only bad thing about the game is eris loris
Its a good game but there are some down sides about it though the update wont let me chat anymore and I cant chose my name anymore hopefully they change this
This game is so good but it didnt let me play on my computer because my mouse wasnt showing ((((( but this is good on my phone
"This very cool game, but i dont like we need to say whats in game i want to say what i want to change name not randomize"
Among us was a really fun game to play with friends but the new update kills the vibe _
"Among us is great an all but I just hate the new update were you cant speak freely,  choose the name of your choice etc. By logging in you can do all of that again but I cannot it wont let me add an email so I can express myself. What do I do"
The reason that i gave 3 stars to among us that we cant chat that when they vote me and im not impostor i cant say no its not me so its bad like that. Please let us enable to chat again then all og among us players we be happy. 
I love the game but can you pls add normal nameschat back I would give this a five star if I could name my selfAnd now Randomized names are like random words together the only good names are fussybook and twoflower(my opinion)
Its a good and fun game and i love it but i will give you a 3 star because i cant change my name and i cant type my own chat
Brill game one of my fave games but a bit laggy and disconnects me
I love the game but just let the chat be like the old one
I love it erveything BUT I DONT LIKE THE CHAT I LIKE THE original Chat SO I GIVE IT 4 STARS Pls change it bk so we can say whatever... Pls its anoying with THE NEW CHAT PLS
"Among us was really fun,  until they update it I mean the chat is broken for the rest though ist quite ok"
"This game is actually horrible after the airship map update.

FIRST its really dumb you cant talk some times some peaple vote me without talking in the chat and some peaple say its me the impostor and i cant even defense myself i cant even say a reason that im not the impostor ,  everything is fine with this game except the chat"
Broo this is my most favourite game I wish you could make the hats and pets for free.Even thought they dont do anything to us. Amogus
Game freezes and kicks me out after trying to boot it so now its unplayable
The game is so bad after the new update. You cant tipe anymore so annoying and there is limited words so bad I used to like the game before. the game is not bad but the update is horrible 
This game is great but I cant sign in and I was clicking resend email and theirs noting on my email
Great game but dont like quick chat rather voice. Also please make a new map Sincerely yours
"I loved this game,  since it started I cant change my name anymore and I can still chat Please come back among us This version is horrible I want it to come as it was in 2020"
We cant chat by our self and we cant speak to each other. So we cant enjoy by playing this game. Except that reasons the game is awesome
It was a nice game but in the update there are way too many bugs now
This is the best i love the new colors and hats and the airship i also like the names there so funny i love the new vote subject airship task are amazing my favorite task is the new vent task
"The texting has become more difficult to use,  other than that its overall a good game."
This game is fun but please can you back the keyboard chat is hard with that chat system
i have to keep instlling it over and over because i can see my mouse but overall a really fun game
Bro the game is good but i gave it 2 starts because i cant type in the chat anymore and its just became boring after a while now i only play minecraft Editok now the update lets me type but if u dont login in u cant type
"Im disconnected from server,  It didnt happen before,  why does it happen now"
the game stopped working for me and can no longer play. please fix this issue soon
this game is awesome but just like some others i complain about the quick chat it is super annoying
"The new chat filter thing sucks,  I cant type unless I give them a shady amount of info to verify Im a adult."
It is easy killing crewmates are easy to win in among us is to hide behind the other crewmate when imoster comes and kills the other crew mate you report and get the imposter off
You need to be able to shoot the imposter also or at least have a shield to defend yourself
I love this game again now that you fix everything and made it how it use to be it is awesome it is one of my favorite games again.
This game is so annoying even the code is real it keeps saying Could not find the game youre looking for plz fix this
Before it was soo good chating was so much easier but now its so ha4d and people dont have time to do that options thing
Its goood but dont really get the piont of the game and why everybody hypes it up. I recommend not to download and waste data and time.
I liked the game but there should be an anti cheat I would love than bit still good game
Everytime I dont get Imposter. I have to turn my Internet Box off and on to just play
It was nice before the update...Its kinda boring becoz of this new update of theirs.u cant even say what u want and that made me lose a lot of times.i dont recommend if u liked the old one better.
Cant even get into the game after this new update even after I uninstalled and re downloaded Enjoyed it while it lasted
when i first got this it was super fun but this new quick chat thing is complete GARBAGE.
I would give it five stars if among us was like it use to be you cant change your name and you cant chat PLZ Make it like it used to be PLZ
"I can only see white,  black,  and gray,  please fix this."
This is the best game I ever have I charge this game first. I love it I love this game Estimated try it out.
I liked this game very much but skins are not coming why that problem
I miss the old one its so hard to communicate now no one talks they only vote its not fun anymore never download among us again youll regret it
It is awesome but now its flipping awfall I got pinged out of game now I have to wait 20 god damn minutes becouse apparently I left on purpose so not happy
I am give 3 stars because old virsion we type with our mind but new version we locked in there five lines please come back old virsions our mind typing option please among us team
disconnected from server problem is really annoying it happens almost everytime
I like the game alot exept alot of glitches are happening the only one ive seen is multiple bodys get reported at the same time.
Im having problems as i joined a lobby when the game is about to start the screen is black and my phone freezers
"Awesome app but there no free chat,  others cant look for what there looking intime"
Super interesting game and good story I love the game one of my favorite but please Keep henry stickmin collection in play store
Pls fix this i cant play among us from old version its fun now new i cant play Fix this now and one STAR
This is cool I play it from phone and the map name submerged is not in my phone and please add new map
What is up with the update this used to be my favorite game but yall just messed it up I cant type on board and it sucks that u Cant put your own name anymore  worst of all the sign in tell me who had the time to put that many passwords
You have to give free chat before the airship update the game was good to play but now it is boring
Fun game but update too bugy i cant even get in a mach so the old chat was better
I used to love this game me and my friends played it everyday before the school banned it but now it just not fun the here my list 1the chat 2it will not let me make an account 3i miss the old among us it was really fun This is not among us its just a fake now
Well i played this game for a while but in one of the recent updates they took away several hats such as my pirate hat. I also cant see anywhere the pets or skins i could buy before. Where did it go
Before this game was so good but now its the worst because of quick chat  to this game nand it always shows permission accessed but it never gives me permission
I like this game really so much the only problem is why the old chat is removed
Its a really nice game but there is lots of lag ... please fix the issue
its so good it have looking and hunting for a imposter and imposter kills crewmates its so fun i keep playing this game hope it get alot of likes
Since They Removed The Ability to talk with keyboard and change names I Stopped playing this game. The Game Is Good But Without those I will probably wont play it any more
I like this game more after find out about the new color and new ship including new tasks.

The game is cool but wine is the airship map I mean the new map coming out the underwater one I was waiting for it like years now or maybe months
Among us was fun me and my siblings used to play among us all the time but after the new update which no one asked for is horrible
very good for children and adults its all over YouTube and funnel vision
I made a review in 2020 about how great it was but in 2021 it got terrible since the update and the release on the switch I cant even change my name anymore the old version was way better so Innersloth needs to change it and also the chat is really boring too Innersloth ruined this game innersloth...Full ReviewI made a review in 2020 about how great it was but in 2021 it got terrible since the update and the release on the switch I cant even change my name anymore the old version was way better so Innersloth needs to change it and also the chat is really boring too Innersloth ruined this game innersloth needs to fix this game if they fix it it well get better ratings and probably more downloads again
This is was the best game I have ever player but I dont like the new chat updateand I cant even name myself  Please restore it to its intial state and I will give it 5 stars
I love thos game so much. But now i hate when i doesnot have a option to type on my own privacy can you please change all things back so i will play this game again
We want to be able to type in the chat box caz it me mad time consuming and its not fun fun
HATEE the update with the text box HORRIBLE they should definitely change is back everything else is great but Im giving it a 1 because that one detail makes the whole game not good
I cant even enter a lobby with out the system telling me that 6 pings have been sent and that my server isnt working
Its fun but every time i try to join it says svr_strmiss it seems to be a bug.
Im laughing out loud this is so horrible my brother came to me and said he wanted to play among us but its notso I put my email in and it said to check my email Torre verification code Im thinking to myself this is a lot of trouble for a childs game how to does this I click on it a wash my socia...Full ReviewIm laughing out loud this is so horrible my brother came to me and said he wanted to play among us but its notso I put my email in and it said to check my email Torre verification code Im thinking to myself this is a lot of trouble for a childs game how to does this I click on it a wash my social security my address my date of birth and the second option is to get my credit card this is a childs game and it is so stupid for the information a do not recommend it is a waste of time and it wan
Its amazing but there is an issue Im playing this game from 1 year but I become crewmate all the time
Good game but it keeps disconnecting me from the server for no reason
"Nice concepts but frequently disconnecting,  unable to add friends."
Its a good game and all but i hate that we cant chat freely. Otherwise is a great game
I like the old among us more I cant even type its so hard to cooperate in the game its just making me more angry when I dont know what to press
A very fun game Sometimes it glitches but overall very fun
Only 2 stars bcz we cant chat anymore it is boring so plz fix these why r u not fixing this everyone is requesting why please fix this
Its fun and enjoyable with friends or just as a pass time. Super addicteing
It was great but i would like the old chat feature back. so please fix it
I die a lot and the game doesnt have that good of texture but the game is great I gotta say
The game use to be fun but the new chat update made it worse because now I cant defend myself when being accused or accuse anyone else due to this
Worst experience Not even downloading additional assets Very bad service Missing old among us.. 
I like this game very much but the new update ruined it by adding auto chat.
The game is fun I play on mobile and pc but I try to sign on pc I need to pay But on mobile its free I dont get it but I love it I just hate the fact thta I need to play for pc and not for mobile but anyways  its great 
The game isnt bad but when the update came were you need to use chat but you cant talk for yourself it got boring
This game is bad because it kicks me for no reason And even when I reported it no one has fixed it WHY
Its really fun and the imposter makes everything harder and better.
"A killer mistery game,  But Thank You Soooooooooo Much For The Updates They Are Awsome And The 11 12 13 14 And 15 Player And The 6 New Colors And New Dead Body Look... So I Like It Waaaaaaay Too much SO 5 STAR"
This game is amazing but i wouldnt say this about much games but the popularity ruined it the update ruined it everything is just gone downhill
"This is where memes came from so yeah 5 stars also the animations are cool,  tho I miss the old among us assets and music"
Its a great game love it just maybe make some more maps so it makes it more interesting
This game sucks the chat and sign up thing is stupid i hate it now pls fix chat we cant say what we want to say fix this pls
"Horrible game design,  too many people looking for relationships,  it is unsafe,  do not have your kid play among us"
This game was fun before the new update but its fine just let us ues the key bord and if someone says something bad kick them from the mach
It was good till they put it where you have a limit of things to say you cant type into it and now it sucks
Its so stupid you cant choose your name nor what you say AND after intentionally leaving a game you have to wait five minutes
This game is amazing. But I would like if you could add some more excitement to the tasks
"I like the game,  even the airship map. But i hated quick chat,  the oldest version of among us has free chat,  and u can also chat freely if who is the Impostor. So plss,  make the among us free chat without signing in. Pls. Im begging u"
"Disconnects almost every game,  makes it difficult to play."

It is a fun game Im enjoying it but why am I giving one star because on July 22 2021 I ran into two chats of teenagers talking very inappropriately. There young kids on this game they dont need be seeing or reading that stuff Im sorry
"This game is awsome keep it up with the update. Im enjoing the Airship, And also there is still some hackers.pls ban eric lorks name.I created my own account in this game.This game is great.I play it all day.keep it up with the updates.Thx innersloth"
This is such a great game but since the new updates its not too good cuz you cant type in what you want to say but other than that its great
In new update among us we cant type in chat any thing and we cant type name fix it to type any thing in chat and name
It used to be so fun but I kinda saw it go in flames bc first off the drama needing to log in to chat with guardians permission is....annoying and it just doesnt get updated alot imma be honest i like the henry stickmin collection more
Amazing game but maybe 1 or 2 bugs need to be fixed
When I look at people play this game it looks cool but I downloaded it and I cant even get inside the game it just laggs me out please fix this
Op game over power this game is very very easy game and my friends play with me and night funny moments in my life
Cant even play a round. It just shows a black screen. Still rating 5 because I can play on PC.
The chat is broken now and the game is dying because of it
"A good game,  but after the upgrade it has to wait alot"
This game very good but we have to money to buy pro clothes but nice 
"this game was good, but the new update, free chat,  6 new colors, EVEN BETTER"
I LIKE The game I like how you added vent cleaning task and there more colours and so much players pls add more updates cuz I like updates I want the submerged map
It is the best ever. So inner sloth keep up the good work and add a gold skin or a diamond skin  PLZ
"Thos game is so, so, so, so good.. I love then am customizing it. I love then am doingfinish_ing the imcomplecte tast. I love when am the  imposter i mean who wouldnt."
The game appears to be good. But I didnt like the way you banned people under age 18 to use free chat. Why you should do that I dont understand.
It has glitches in it the doors wont open the body reported keeps on repeating all over somebody needs to fix this game
No a fence I like among us just I wish there where more updates like new ruels and new maps thats just all I want.
"The game used to be great and fun but now the game sucks they changed it way to much,  I miss the old version of it"
Great game but I think betrayal io is taking the crown for games like this.... but cool game it updated alot more )
"When I sign into my Google play account,  everytime it doesnt work,  get old among us back"
"They ruined the game,  dont beleive me play it now that its been updated,  the chat is so annoying and its just bad."
Woooooow this update is terrible. I know I know more skins and whatnot but its eating away at my storage and it isnt even that great.
The the game is nice but nowdays we cant write our own name and we cant chat properly there will be options and when we download it we have to wait for one thing if it will be improve then its my fav among us if u see my cimment then plz answer my request plz
"Not gonna lie,  the game is amazing. I like the new update you guys gave us.

But can you PLEASE do something about the roleplayers who are destroying the game and its reputation who ban people who do not have deku or baku,  or anything related to some anime characters. I try to avoid these lobbies,  but they show up so frequently that Im sure other players share the same frustration. Once again,  I love playing it,  but the roleplayers and the creeps who have notsopg13 names ruin it."
I wish they would bring back the old way to chat know its no fun to lie my but off.
"The game isnt fun at all, I cant even start the game.This must be fixed."
Good game great detail and a awsome layout also thers very few bugs
"I used to love it,  but the new update sucks and it has a terms of use and privacy policy with unreasonable statements"
Its a great strategy game and I want like a way that you can add people as your friend.
Its really fun I play this game all day but I dont like the new update I liked it better when we type our own name instead of names like uphill and deadtoe and one more thing I think I speak for everyone when I say WE CHOOSE WHAT TO SAY
I Dont know how is so cool but we or you and me play this game is cool and no ads but all game like this got ads  but i dont know how and is good but i love or like it so i will give a 5 is cool so is 5 or 4 is cool and is fun tooooo or is so so so sooooo funn i love it i will say like wow wow...Full ReviewI Dont know how is so cool but we or you and me play this game is cool and no ads but all game like this got ads  but i dont know how and is good but i love or like it so i will give a 5 is cool so is 5 or 4 is cool and is fun tooooo or is so so so sooooo funn i love it i will say like wow wow wow woww ilke a 1000 or 45000000 time so cool and fun .

I used to love this game but after the update it become so bored please give us back the chat function 
Ur games in comma now its gonna die because. Of the update it was horrible fix it now everyone one wants the update fix when you fix it ill give you 5 stars
"Its the best you can play with friends,  family,  and even strangers. I Its very fun its cool to play and yeah thats why I give it a 5."
Plz change the chat option it us very difficult explain and chat .Auto chat is just time wasting
This Game is awesome Imposters kills others crewmates and if i get imposter i will kill the crewmates And if i get crewmate its boring

Horrible its a game that will get you made fun of its a game that u cant talk to people its absolute garbage
Its okay but laggs for me and get disconnected.
This game was so fun but then it is so boring now because of the new chat thing.
I always get disconnected and I cant finish the game please fix itttttt
Fix your game pls cuz I get a black screen when I join and its frozen the black screen wont go away and I dont see the game
If i could give it zero stars i would cause this game is rigged everytime im about to win a game i get disconnected 99.9 of the time i hate this
Ugh you have a nice game I like the but there something I can say I really love this but sometimes it works so I pgave the game 5 stars
Good game but I cant sign in I wanna use full game feature but i cant because I cant sign in please fix it
This game is so fun and also we have to use our brain.You cannot trust anyone.You dont know who is the crewmate or the imposters.If you see anyone doing a task which is not in the list it means that they are imposters.
Its Nice even though we have Quick Chat now. After some days youll get used to it.
I HATE THIS STUPID QUICK CHAT AND WHEN IT SAYS 1015 PLAYERS IT WILL ALWAYS SAY THE GAME YOU TRIED TO JOIN IS FULL WHEN ITS NOT ITS SO ANNOYING THIS GAME WAS SO GOOD BEFORE
"You really you could make your own name,  but now that you can organize your name,  its not fun anymore,  and its really hard now,  I hate it but Ill play"
I love this game but I hate it when the room closes of inactivity can you please remove that and can our names be longer
"Is there a new SUBMERGED map made my s5p Idk but I saw ssundee play the map look s5p if your watching this join innorsloth and make the map of The private cruise ship make this map Ive made and drawn a lot 9f comics (shorts) Ya like and the imposter has new ability he can summon karaken and new ...Full ReviewIs there a new SUBMERGED map made my s5p Idk but I saw ssundee play the map look s5p if your watching this join innorsloth and make the map of The private cruise ship make this map Ive made and drawn a lot 9f comics (shorts) Ya like and the imposter has new ability he can summon karaken and new skins For free like captain hat , suit, pants,  and theres a new spiecial captain hat called the ultima hat this thing has the ability to zoom out new sabotage flood ( 186 sec)and oxygen (50 sec)"
"Nice game but 5star because of quick chat,  In next update please fix this innersloth"
Love it very interesting but chat system were good previously..
This game is absolutely trash its unbelievable my 11 year old boy wants to play this game. But he cant because he is below the age of 18. For him to play i have to pay 50 cents. There is no way i am going to give even one cent to this trash game
This game is amazing but only one thing please let mods for the game be available on android. If so would be a 5 star
This game is so fun Ik its not as popular as it once was but it is still a really good game. Nothing bad to say about it. I would definitely recommend
Hey among us can you ever add a friend list please and I like the new update remastered ejects remastered venting and walking remastered characters new colors new meeting or body reported love it keep up the good work and please add a friend list ok and also add voice chat please.
so funny and a lot of mysteries and find the Imposter
"I love this game,  but the update has just made me mad but overall it a really good game."
Thank you for fixing now this game has been easy and very understandable  keep doing what you are doing
Chnage ut back to normal NOW this is so stupid and i think its impossible to injoy the game when you cant even talk to people in the game when you have to you emojies you ruined the game you dumb people.
Does not enter even when I have sublime internet connection when I enter a match it switches to play store
From the best game to the worst one..... Good job . Unistalling this game for good. No quick chat 
Well you definitely wont be getting modded lobbys but ads are there ..if only I could link my paid account from the computer so itd stop showing ads
Great game but I wish there was something like impostor chat so impostors can cooperate.
Remove the auto chatting option it feels like Im playing with robots.
"This is not something Id personally be intrested in,  I miss the old amoung us. But,  It is still a good game for others who like it"
Guys I really love this game you get to be the detective theres a new map  and the door is a brandnew 15 player Lobby and with cleaning vents
It used to be so fun quick chat was something cool now u just cant explain stuff this is broken fix it
Great game but it would be better if it was free chat again Im cool with the names but i want to freely chat on my own
This game is really good fun to play with friends and cool hats to wear and all I enjoy being imposterthat was what I wrote few months ago the quick chat update ruined it
I have to say the game is very interesting I like to see some more interactive task in the future
Guys pls remove the quick chat and enable the free chat the quick chat is tough to use and even confusing we cant chat what we want that makes it super annoying pls enable the free chat
Its a great game but please fix it I cant buy pets or skins
I love this game but the vision sucks PLEASE fix it    
Whats the use of having this app if the game screen goes black after the host starts the meeting This is very disappointing for many fans like me.
"Wow awesome thanks among us for giving new update and now this game in legendry ,  and very very thanks for making another for giving mods cant wait for new update."

"U have no liberty to do anything like typing or changing the name I am just mad ,  so I quit the game it used to be very good before but now its just boring to play I cant even type there is no voice chat just some questions and accusations"
BEST EVER nice grapic lol nice can become a dectective (edit) its boring now hackers are increasing the game is ruined no good updates people can swear freely now hackers have the ability to tell who is the impostor and end the game so its boring
"I love this game,  but I would like this in the game,  It would be good for you guys at Innersloth LLC to put a Greeting message on the Quick Chat so we can aleast say Hello. That would be amazing I give this 5 stars if put the Greeting message"

I cant update the game to submerged map update.
I used to love this game but due the new update everything is ruined. I love if Innersloth removed the account option.
I love this game but it isnt responding ana it automatically uninstalled and it is not installing. Among team please check
This game is good but if we play more and.more then it make us mental so play games but not too much
I love this game but I want old update becasue that update is good but I love it this new update too I want to search in voting but I cant search so I want old searching plzs..
Pretty overated. Nice but you cant play for a long time gets boring

This game is nice I tried 1 hour to get imposter on this game but always crewmate crewmate crewmate I am very angry with the game everyone will be imposter and I always crewmate that why I gave3 stars

This game is the best I have ever played in my life Well done but whoever is from mobile  tablet must get the words he wants to write from the box Make it
"Youll get permanently banned for calling someone an idiot,  send in an email and still not hear back over 2 months later. Trash support,  game was fun while it lasted."
"I like among us and I play and I love the cleaning vent task, but i watched a ytube vid and it said that on June 25th submerged map will come and its already June 25th and why isnt it come"
I keep getting kicked off before I can even join a game. Please fix this.
OMG this game it will Go okay for a few weeks but all of a sudden it will not work
But if you sign in then you can write your own name and its all yours choice if you want to write your own chat or name or you can choose your own chat or name
A lot of things changed I miss the old one honestly and now you have to make an account to change ur name I think idrk anymore but the update is kinda cool
Ever since the new update Ive been I kicked out of almost every game due to server issues
This is the best game its just there is a darker green in the loby but dark and lime green have been taken so its kinda creepy
I loved among us it is not much that fun i want chat freely it hurt my heart i will still play it but not much anymore it is hard to chat makes it less fun 
A very fun game but i lost all my onnline friends in among us so i really wish we can add friends so can u make an update to add friends pls thanks )
Its very fun Game and i love this Game but we always Be Crewmate thats not a good Thing........thats it )
Warning This game doesnt work on 5G It only works on 4GLTE and lower. FACTS.. Like this comment so they will fix this game.
Super fun I hate the only thing I hate is the new update made it had to have a conversation.
"It was really fun before the update,  me and my friends are enjoying it too much but now we didnt even talk about this game. Too sad i was disappointed about thr update"
Very good. The game new update is very good. I am impressed. Thx for update. I am exited for the submerged map
It was a good game but now I hate it because you have to sign into to use free chat and the mods wont work and I want my normal username
"Now its soo much better.i love the game all the military strategy, thinking and suspense."
Hey um.. can you please make the update has free chat and name please I dont want that you put name and why you put chat with no free chat please.. I want the old version update is better please put the old version so I can rate it 10005 yea so I really miss that one Thank you
It sucks you cant type what u want anymore also google play cannot connect
Its fine. Im only rating it 1 star because to make an account u need to put ur social security number (or a different one thats important) Or ur credit card.. its personal information.
Pls bring back the normal chat pls the game is so boring because I cant chat I know youre doing this so no people can swear but what if someone swears and just kick them then if they want to play again put a 30 or more minutes or low minute pls just pls bring the chat back pls
I used too love this game but this stupid new update i hate it so please its not the colors or the skin that you did but its only the typing I hate that so please change it
Why i gave 1stars cuz the game cant free chat and have to log in .then i have to buy skins so give public skin
I give it 3 stars cause its have the thing (new chat maker) and I hate it so much I cannot chat myself please fix that. Im begging you
I love it its a great game but it sometimes it lags but over all its a great game
"It doesnt work. Before it does anything else,  it kicks me out of the app. Not good innersloth"
Ever since you had to pay to chat this game has been bad how can I explain how Im not wrong if the wording doesnt match what Im trying to say
Among Us is not fun because you basically do the same thing over and over and over again which is why I give it three stars
Before the game did not need credit card info so why now.Im not complaning about the account but why you need credit card info why cant you have a reguler create an account even wen i try to play it without a account it wont even let me play (
I dont know why but when i try to go press the public button where u find servers (i thinks thats whats it called) it wont work.
"THIS APP IS LITTLE BIT  BUT WE CANNOT unlock free pets,  costume etc so I m going to give only one star... thank u....very much........."
THIS IS MY FAVORITE AND BEST GAME BECAUSE IT CONTAIN ADS BUT I SEE ITS CUSTOMIZE HAS TWO NEW AND DIFFERENT COLOR BECAUSE I LOVE THE COLOUR 
This new update is hard for imposters Please add some bright colours
It still does not work I still can not free chat it does not let me change it to free chat it still says quick chat it does not let me change it
Very buggy.. used to be good. Now u cant even discuss on Android phones
Stupid chat filter just ruined the game. I stopped playing this months ago
I love this game you can play with players your either the imposter or a crewmate
The thing I hate about this game is its communication update that is the worst thing in my life if u did not add this feature I would give this game 5stars
The game dont want to play.i Deleted it so many times and install it but still nothing.is was playing fun all the time.
In the chat system you cant say wat you want any more ... it makes it realy hard to do things(
This game is so bad now. before you were playing good but now its different now they remove you from the matchgame even when you are the impostor they put you out
"This game is trash,  doesnt let me play with other people cant even go into matchmaking. Stuck on main screen."
The update ruined it dont play the game used to be good but the update everyone was excited for made the game suck remove accounts remove quick chat keep map and clean vent 15 players but quick chat and no names suck
I play the game before the great update i loved the ood chat please bring the old chat back the new one suck over all it chould have been better i really miss the old chat
"It was fun before , but now I updated it and now i cant type anything .It gives me choices of words and I cant even pick my own name now"
this game is really great but i miss the old once( the one we normally chatt (
Its a nice mystery game and also I like the fact you can turn on your own friends )
I think its good but it keeps on stopping in the middle of the game which is annoying so I would give it five but its just that
"Can you add hide n seek mode in the game. It would fun to play hide n seek,  everyone wants it."
"So good to play, if u want to chat and change or name u will sign in.Its so fun to play with friend"
I love it Im just angry of the update you cant say what you want to say you have to use this button. But ITS FUN
Everything is great except for that almost every server has something sexually related or they use this game for dating its getting really annoying.
I would make it 5 star but update is super bad chat taking too bad you cant to how you want to
The game was great until they updated it bc when it updated i couldnt play anymore And it was making me really mad and not wanting to install it ever again
It was good love the new improvements only dislike that I cant type on my own.
This game is very good. And kinda creepy ngl like who killy kills someone....maney me lol. But I recommend this game to u very good no LAG or anything. Enjoy it bc I am 
"Horrible I can get into menu its a big glitch in the game ,  please fix it"
this game is amazing and all but the chat... its kinda annoying but fuigerd how to chat normaly
Not nice I mean I like it but everytime I go into a match its says you disconnected but my internet is fast Please do something about this
I havent played this game for months and now it is trash. The chat is limited to speech and fun of the game. No wonder 6M reviews give 1 start smh
This game was best game when we use our own name free chat but now this game is bad plz give free chat to all among us player we if we want free chat so we have to sign in but peaple cant sign in and I am one of them I watch all videos for free chat i tried many times but i cant use free chat so a...Full ReviewThis game was best game when we use our own name free chat but now this game is bad plz give free chat to all among us player we if we want free chat so we have to sign in but peaple cant sign in and I am one of them I watch all videos for free chat i tried many times but i cant use free chat so among us plz give free chat
I would rate it 3 stars because some players say A LOT of inappropriate stuff on the servers.
The game has improved after the new update but black screen glitch is still there
Good app I would play if I had nothing to do but the update is so dumb I cant say what I want to I have to sign up I liked the old version a lot more  but 55 if it was the old one 35 now sorry
I just hate that we cant chat unless we have a Google account but clean the vent is funny
"I love everything,  but you guys should add friends option to make friends around the world plzzz"
I just use to love this game about a few months ago with my friend but lately its like we have no freedom to chat let alone inviting others
"If you want to chat like the old version,  just use your play account."
I give it a 4 because like theres some new bugs like when i try to talk to my freinds like it wont work and i have to use thr annoying comands to like say stuff like A was blababa
i dont like the update where u have to have parents permision bc either way any 1 can find a way to chat to them. not just that but my parents dont like giving their info out and think this game is just trying to steal their money. so now i cant play it like i want to. i like being able to choose my...Full Reviewi dont like the update where u have to have parents permision bc either way any 1 can find a way to chat to them. not just that but my parents dont like giving their info out and think this game is just trying to steal their money. so now i cant play it like i want to. i like being able to choose my name an everything like that but i cant. i get it really but if parents are really worried about it then just watch over them or dont let them have the game. simple as that. it kinda ruins the fun.
I love it but can you give free skins especially RHM and pets. And can you give free typing for Samsung S 5 and more
Its fun except for the bug that it does not send the code to my email
Thank you for bringing back the chat system back to normal.You deserved 5 stars because you listen to your fans.
I really like this game but I would like a voice chat feature
Account error and disconnection for local play. This game is a joke.
"What I hate from this game is that hackers are now in the open so the game has a high risk of hackers now,  they keep using hacks to have no kill cooldown,  discovering imposters etc. Pls find a way to ban these hackers."
Soooooooo yea I loved this Game when I was 5 but now I hate it I cant change my name and I cant just spam random things it the chat to annoy people soo yea among us please fix that
"All time favourite game , cant type in chat please fix these glitch"
Best game and can you crate a update that is about we players can make are own map please add this
Please make it free in pc after you added quick chat its very difficult say some words
One problem when i click public game the loading started and the game is not opening 
"This game going too irritating old version is always best of this game,  because we cant type."
I reinstalled it then when it got updated it sucks I cant make my name Mina any more and cant even say hello in the chat sooooo BAD NOW I USED TO LOVE THIS GAME
Its terrible in the recent updates the reason for this is because I cannot add my email.
Its a great game but sometimes it is sooooo lagy i rate this 4 out of five . i hope this review helped
ITS SO GREAT I CAN PUT MODS AND ANYTHING idk why theres a 2 and 1 starts here with complaint but there just dramatic everything is just fine with the game
"More modes would be nice there are only three. Also,  itd be nice if we could speak."
Now the game ui is too much complex.. Specially chat section.. I unistalling it
it was good untill it keeps saying that the server is full and then disconnects so I hope u fix this pls

New update is very good. I love the vent task but I think itll make it less fair for the imposter.
Best appevwr all bugs are fixed and a nice game and one more thing you should remove that account system okay by the way its a very good app
"When the game starts , it shows black screen and i am not able to play the game and shows only black screen and nothing ."
I used to like it but the new chat system is horrible it hard to comunicate
Well I like this game but I cant even explain anything and it takes to long when you have the Shhhh Plz fix this

Ok its good but after it is updated the chat box and things got bad so 3 stars

Its a very good game but I want them to remove the chat part thing so please fix that
Guys please put the game style like it was in 2020 the game got really buggy and laggy and it is unplayable i really liked it back in 2020 so put it back to 2020 game style please i would really like it
A very good and heartwarming game. Such a shame that not many people play it anymore.
I like the game but I wish you could bring the free talk and not the dashboard thing
For the mobile version its pretty good. Would recommend the PC or Console version over this however
This game is so fun but if they gave us a free skin it would be bettee cuz every one flexs with there skins
It is a bit laggy but u should add a freinds ability or a sherrif and hero that would be great and fun
I. Cant even play it it keeps saying reliable packet 3 (size17) was not ackd after 7531ms (9 resends)
I love this game but im cunfused on why it takes so long for me to join but overall i love this game
The game never works I cant get into any games no matter how much I uninstall and reinstall
This game was amazing before you ruined it with the update. Literally everything fun about it is gone now and I deleted it within one round. Fix it or no one will keep playing
I have a glitch. when ever i check admin map at cockpit my game get stuck...
Why does the game require internet to open Why cant we chat as normal as before
Hi Im sorry for what i said now i understand how this game work Thank you so much The update was amazing and keep up ur good work
I liked this game and I wanted it from edges and I like in real life too so this game made my wish true
I still love this game but I like the old version because its easier and we can type
It would be better if you could just talk normally without you having parental consent. Or change your name because I went throughy about 100 names till is saw one I liked
Really great game but a few bugs sure they are fixing
Yes its a cool game But Please disable quick chat I hate that thing please disable quick CHAT
My experience was horrible we can even chat and it keeps disconnecting me and it wont let me make my own server I do not like the new update you know yall game is getting unpopular this game used to be the best game ever but now should I say the worst game ever
I wish the update didnt happen cuz even tho you can talk free now you have to sign in to pick your name and it wont let me pick my name cuz it wont let me sign in Im really upset about this and I dont know why you have to sign in to pick your own name and its really stressful so please fix thi...Full ReviewI wish the update didnt happen cuz even tho you can talk free now you have to sign in to pick your name and it wont let me pick my name cuz it wont let me sign in Im really upset about this and I dont know why you have to sign in to pick your own name and its really stressful so please fix this glich I really love this game but I really like picking my name so please fix and and thank you for your time.
Its awesome but the joystick control is a bit difficult
Its the best game ever that are seen in my life only if you could be the imposter and a crew make and then only I like the sound of the kale
"The reason i gave two stars was because in the game you have to be the imposter,  and nobody else is the imposter and it is so boring"
I love this game but can you please make the chat normal instead of quick chat
Its a great app but I wish that the rooms wouldnt close cuz of inactivity
"To help the people who are disappointed about Quick chat,  you can change it in setting,  hope this helped"
Look what me out on why this is 1 star back in 2018 this game was very fun almost too fun but then it got really popular salty people and now people with discord like OMG RED SUS its pissing me off I miss back in the old days when hackers were just funny I miss people just having fun not caring abou...Full ReviewLook what me out on why this is 1 star back in 2018 this game was very fun almost too fun but then it got really popular salty people and now people with discord like OMG RED SUS its pissing me off I miss back in the old days when hackers were just funny I miss people just having fun not caring about winning
Its a lot better no that Ive fixed it and the new map has a lot more to look at and do and I like it
among us is a great game the only thing that I dont like is the quick chat but other than that it is a great game
This app is very good and easy . I love It and amazing things in It . I love to do tasks . It helps me a lot . I love when I go faster and faster 
"45 the game is very fun And ofc the game is literally fun,  but theres alot of hackers pls do updates"
Great game and it would be even better if we could talk to other players in game
Bring the old the old typing chat back where you can type in the chat Among Us who who made among us then he fix it fit back on my God
Amazing game but we want more features And improve game play type
It gets boring real easy Pluse all the changes are like Fortnite changes it makes da game worse but you could
"The new update is useless coz i cant chat with any one,  i have to only select the option to text , the keyboard is also not visible  thats why i m giving this game only one "
I love this game but i like old screen for voting or for any emergency meeting that is why i give 4 stars
I added 4 stars because of the chat update its the stupidest thing ever if you remove the chat update Ill do 5 stars
I find it stupid that you cant you cant enter your own text. Probably bc of cussing but this game is about murder and lying. 
The most Popular game ever but this game very glitches very much this is the 1st most hating thing 2nd is we become crew 100 times this is sooo Annoying so at least please make the game little good 2nd in the popular games
"Game WAS good,  till many people use the app to Catfish little kids,  many bots hope this helps out"
It keeps kicking me out games and when I join with friends my screen goes black
Its a pretty fun game and all but it doesnt let me write what I want to like if I wanted to say hi to my friend oh no I cant do that if I want to tell you guys something I saw thats funny in the game Ono I can tell you that so if you take away the thing that doesnt let you write what you want t...Full ReviewIts a pretty fun game and all but it doesnt let me write what I want to like if I wanted to say hi to my friend oh no I cant do that if I want to tell you guys something I saw thats funny in the game Ono I can tell you that so if you take away the thing that doesnt let you write what you want to write Ill be fine with giving this 5 stars
So amazing update just make it 5 imposters and bring back the old discussion thing but I love this game 
"Luv It But I Hope U Can Do Like Outside Map ( House,  Shopping mall ) Not easy just a recommendation D tee hee"
"idk why black screen appears when the game is about to start,  I loved this app before but now... I just dont know. Sadly,  I am disappointed with it "
Please change the chat but its a real fun game but please change the CHAT
This game used to be so good but since then quick chat thingy its been bad
"THIS GAME IS BAD,  ALL I LIKE ABOUT THIS GAME IS THE MEMES,  WHATS THE POINT OF CHAT IF U CAN ONLY QUICK CHAT THE LATEST UPDATE HAD RUINED THE ENTIRE GAME,  IF THERES A ZERO STAR OPTION I WOULD PICK THIS IN THIS STAGE OF THE GAME,  FIX IT TO GET BETTER REVIEWS."
I like this game because its about teamwork and safe for kids so i love it its so good learning
Everything is great. But having a friends list would be a cherry on top 
"I like this game and all,  but the only problem is that the vent cleaning task doesnt appear in my task bar,  so Im not supposed to clean the vent"
Please disable quick chat and enable manual chatting PLEASE it is really annoying
I love this game and its great you dont get bullied and you still have online interactions your also not able to cuss
This game is sus.

Are the characters actually wearing astronaut suits if there is An astronaut skin If there already astronauts why do they not take them off in Mira hq and the airship Why do I weigh more in this game than in real life but Im over 3 feet tall I am a kid so I weigh like 58 pounds. I dont know the answer but this game is awesome.
To be honest the game is fun but some times it it can glich and it lags
"Disconnected error is too much and I cant even play,  people are too toxic,  worst game ever"
i used to love this game but the chat is ruined FIX it the Chat is literally the crewmates only tool in the game

It is a very fun game some times it will say you are disconnected
I think its a really fun game but I spent money on it before the big account update and it didnt give me the stuff I paid for how do or I can I get it back
Its very great game and we can also use to know what people think these days.
"Just experienced a flinch when its stuck on the dead body reported,  please fix this"
This is perfect good game good roles but minuse 2 stars cos minuse 1 cos of quick chat minuse 1 star no custome names but ill never let you down never ever
"Iam giving four star because please add pets and skinsfor free and cant change if also signed in,  there is no keyboard for typing freely so please make these advantage"
great game but needs knew game modes if that is a option.
idk y i always  DISCONNECTED from asia server. Please fix it ( i want to play it w all my friends.
Cant even get on says no servers available. No maps show up since the recent update
Even tho the game had ups and downs they brought back free chatting And even details to the characters

Submerged map was going to be realised late July . July is already over then where is the submerged map
Please add the chats again...the new chat system is so confusing

Very entertaining I love playing this game because it is like a mystery game. You must download this game  5 star
This game is cool but please remove the chat command its annoying
Half the gameplayer names are totally inappropriate. Reporting seems to do nothing. Shouldnt let kids near this game unless they at least censor the names.

I cannot even enjoy the game. I always disconnect. Pls fix this asap
Among us has really gotten better so I decided to change my review. Its still a really fun game and I cant wait for more updates.
Well Its still a good game but I still dont like people saying tan is the worse but tan was in the game back then ( poor tan and I was the person to do the new colours update plz dont hate it or you will have bad lucky
This game is well....but the update is not well..many problem fix it
Good game but it glitches and kicks me off my game...
.this game sucks now the new version really sucks why do we need to sign in now it sucks more then rip off plushes
Among Us is soooo fun you can be the imposter or crewnate although im always the crewmate and when im the imposter i always get caught
I sign into my account but when i try to join people and make games it wont work plz fix this its happing to my little brother too
The game was fixed thank you inner sloth and a meme is a feacture you can clean vents. I LOVE THE UPDATES please continue updating.You really make my day.
OK ty for adding back free chat and now the game is even better
I like this game but the controls and the chat is not good but I still like it
This game used to be so much fun but now its just boring I cant get type in nothing 
Keeps saying this room was made with the incorrect version when I try to join my boyfriend and we both have the update please fix this
Im really sorry but I dont like how you added randomize names please remove it and auto chat also how The new map 5up made I cant get )
Its fun but the update destroyed it I cant see anything so I have deleted it many times and reinstalled it
"love the new actualization,  they fixed all the errors"
This is the best and the reason for quick chat is for children under 12 and good for everyone
It used to be a really fun game but now that they have changed it up its just not as fun.
Cant type things so annoying to use option speech
Literally so fun and its for all ages I would highly recommend downloading this it is like so fun and I love it who the hell wouldnt download it 
It has a lot of errors like when im impostor It disconnects me.
Game is trash like why are people calling emergency mitting 5 seconds in this game this game was fun but some guy behind the computer though it was good idea to update the game I take time out of my day to play this trash game i shoud get payed forr this
Bruh dont miss the old one its just very fun if you dont like it if you find new games you now boring with all the games is cool I can chat with the settings
"The Update Is Cool And Sick And The AirShip Is Here And New Color But Everytime Im The Imposter and imposter again not crewmate once But its fun being Im imposter when you kill somebody but like I get killed by the imposter its just so bad if imposter kills you but you can call emergency meeting...Full ReviewThe Update Is Cool And Sick And The AirShip Is Here And New Color But Everytime Im The Imposter and imposter again not crewmate once But its fun being Im imposter when you kill somebody but like I get killed by the imposter its just so bad if imposter kills you but you can call emergency meeting and say Its Red, Green, Or Even Yellow But I Wish among us was updated For so manytime likely but me like it was out in 2018 it was a long time ago but I have play before It Was fun and good so much."
The reason because I got it 2 stars I miss the old less people like 10 and it is when emergency is pressed it is different 
This is a very nice game but please give the chat option again everyone is saying this
Its a good game but when I hit 15 players it lags sooooo much but I give it 810.
IT IS Awesome.. you can finallly sign in to google play games and the bugs r getting fixed
This Game Is Good To Play With Friend But Sometime When I Found A Nice Guy At That Room I want to be friend but he doesnt have discord and thats make me sad. I lose my friend after the game. I hope this review make you think too add friend add
Its a great game but i cant play 2 maps and your stuck on quick chat and pepole who leave
1010 I love this game I have bloody soft toys its that good so if you dont like this game shame on you because this as cute player icons so I love among us
Its a really fun game I love it but the quick chat sucks and I got stuck with a name that I hated my my I am 15 and I cant use free chat hope quick chat gets removed
I love this game this game is popular I love it I want to recomend that this game is the I also said to my friends and they are playing well in 2 days  I also rated 5 stars
Good game but have a lot of bugs in it
I have not been on among us in a while but if the game chooses your chat pls change it I rely want to say what I want to say u should put it if somebody says something bad we can report them thats what the next update should be in my opinion
Its fun but chat sucks but the more I play the more it gets easier.
This game is good but very hard to connect to servers and need to connect a best vpn to play Please take it easy innersloth
"UI is rubbish, god knows why they messed with it, otherwise a good game."
My problem is that when we report the body when we open the chat why just we cant type in our wish to what to write .
why did they do this to the game cant we just freely chat and keep it like how it was
It was the best game now IM ALWAYS RAGING BC WE CANT USE THE CHAT EVEN IF U LOG IN U BETER FIX THE GAME AND MORE PEOPLE WOULD PLAY LIKE THE CHAT
This game is amazing download it one problem tho when ur walking sometimes ur shirt or jacket will clip through ur body pls fix this
People are toxic and team the game has to many fortnite kids and people act like there good but there is some good things but to many bad things to balance out the good.
I gave it 4 stars Because the quick chat is So annoying But its still good but could you take quick chat off
You know you can make people chat freely without account please remove accounts and make people chat freely change their names what they want I liked that before it changed but I still play among us ok
It is awesome but the loading screen is black and the music is playing
Whats up with disabling type messages and just have a set of options only Ruined the whole game
The onky thing that makes this not get 5 stars is Quik chat i hate it sooooooooooooo much more players quit Among Us because Quick chat so add free chat for free
I like the update but I hate the chat on mobile pls change the mobile chat its very annoying playing like that
"This was an amazing,  entertaining and fascinating game Ive ever played ,  please everyone play and reply ,  Cant wait for Among Us 2 "
The update is nice but i hate the chat they will be saying the same thing(
I loved this game but it doesnt even let me play it anymore. I uninstalled and reinstalled it several times.
"Many of you crews think that the new update dont allow you to write or change name,  you guys listen carefully. THE GANE IS STILL THE SAME,  YOU JUST HAVE TO DOWNLOAD GOOGLE PLAY APP,  AND OPEN AMONG US AND SIGN IN BY SHOWINGBYOUR AGE ABOVE 18. by that you can chat and change name. Btw,  great game."
Its a very fun experience And you could play with friends family or cousins and You could team which isnt something I like
"I used to love this game.Now, I cant choose my own name and you cant say what you want to say anymore.I loved the old one alot more then the new update"
I just saw a few reviews that said there is ads in the game. But isnt Innersloth themself removed the ads at last year
The fact that you have to put some effort really shows that they were not messing around.
Your games are seeming to evolve backwards this update is horrible you dont have the freedom of speech you only choose from the blocks. Ill take my data elsewhere since this game isnt that good anymore Ill just play other rip off versions seeing as they are better
"Game sucks,  takes too long to start s game. Find something else."
Love the game but hate how restricted the talking is. Fiz that and it is a 5 star
I like this game and the graphics are cool but sometimes when I play this game it skips
That chat is dumb you have to go through a scroll wheel just to talk so dumb.
Fun but keep getting disconnected... Its getting annoying..
I like the game the only problem is that when I am imposter I lose because of voting and when Im crewmate I die because of the imposter and it always makes me crewmate but I still like it
The loading is so long. Do i need to be online to load this game The last time i played this the loading was so fast. Please i need to know cause i want to play this.
I love app i just want them to fix the bugs like getting kicked for no reason and people using mods
I use to love this game when i can type but now we have tobuse something to type later the new update the game started to suck
I love among us very much but remove the terrible chat thing we cant write what we want o god I just hate that feature just remove it
I love this game I love when Im imposter and crewmate I love the designing and the tasks are cool I know you guys spent alot of time to make this game for us
This game it used to be so much fun but it just a piece of poop now... It suck basically do not play it
I like it but I dont love to be a crewmate because I kept on dying so I love to be an imposter very very very very really really like it very very very much so i play it all day long........................................................................................................................Full ReviewI like it but I dont love to be a crewmate because I kept on dying so I love to be an imposter very very very very really really like it very very very much so i play it all day long.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
I miss old chat and looks suckie I us to play it all the time but now its a piece of trash
Good game but the is one problem its always getting errors
Hate it. innersloth should hear this i hate this update when i press online it does nothing just loads for EVER uninstall right now waste of 90 gigabites
Script kiddies are ruining the game by spamming crisis and locking lobbies down. Making themselves imposter and murdering everyone while the voting is going on. Game sucks now.
"I think that you have to remove the new chats because we can only talk about imposter and not able to make jokes and funny comment or any other talk and we cant chane our name that we want.If you fix this new chat and name, I will give this game five star rating"
I love the original game pls put it back the new game sucks so much the new map is like a maze so big and the chat is hard
Every time i try to play a game my screen stays black once it stayed black for literally over an hour
This game is fantastic fun and just keeps getting better. Please add it to the Amazon app store so I can play it on my fire tablet
I like this game its fun but idk how to do mods in the game.but all tho I still like this game.I am finding how to get mods. Id also want the creator to make more mods
the update is why i dont play anymore. its hard to play not signed in. and the new chat is so bad that i imeddiently get voted out because i cant explain myself quickly
Game was good but this is a glitch or problem idk but i open game assets download not start plz fix this
Ive been having serious issues with connection and glitching.
I love this game but please add friend request option so i could stop losing good friends.
This is my revised post I love it its also engaging and its popular so there will always be a server
I like the game but why did you change the chat please change the chat to free chat again
I get disconnected from all servers before i even search for a game
Its so nice but if u can let us type from the keyboard again because it is easier. And what about adding friends
Coolest game can you add a feature to voice chat and add roadmap in 2 november Also add pizza skin and hat and add burger hat and add rick ashleys hat and also the last thing is PLZ ADD AMONG US 2 PLZZZZZZ
Hi developers I am having problem that when I click online and then I click public (find game) its not showing any thing and when I click on the server icon Its just showing north america so please help me
The update is horrible i cant chat properly i love the maps and added hats Im kinda annoyed by the chat you have to choose what to respond plss change the chat to the original plssssss 
"Not good game this game has glitches , lag, hand i buy a new gaming phone on this phone i face to face these problems  please editor fixed it because I a lover and a fan of this game"
"I like being the imposter,  but Im gonna say this ONCE and im gonna say it CLEAR get rid of the chat COMMANDS,  you guys are making it no fun "
Its great i just request that the ladder bug gets fixed)
"My thoughts on Among Us Great game,  there are a few connection issues thats about it,  so,  5 stars."
Very good but mabye change the position the astronaut helmet is
"Game concept awesome,  game ping so bad it dont load"
I used to love this game but now I hate it with the new update. Please do something cause I really enjoyed playing this game
Lag automatically . Being crewmate 20 times continuously
The reason why i did not make one star because the chat i dont like im gonna find my speech to chat so thats why

"The game is good,  but please for the next update add the friend feature and send messages to friends plsD"
When I leave it literally just says may not join until 5 minutes of disconnecting like fix your game PLEASE
Bad because of signing email no free chat and no choosing names first version when it got popular was very good so bring it back to that
"I dont like how you cant type what you wanna type,  the give you options."
U CANT USE NORMAL GOD DAM CHAT IN THIS GAME I USED TO LOVE IT BUT NOW I HATE FIX THIS
This game is cool but It gets boring without the free type and sometimes I becomes impostor
So happy there is free chat now and more colors )
I think its ridiculous how you have to put an ssn or card info and pay 50 cents if you want an optinal name or free chat.
You need to make the chat normal again not customize.
Love it and how simple it is no adds and love the sradigi of aswell
Gud game but they need to add more stuff like i by mistake in my account amog us one i did my age 13 i am 18 now i cant chat and stuff please do something about it
Loved this game before the update now its impossible to say anything people just vote who ever reported thats not fun
Same goes to me I always get disconnected thats why I cant play on my iPad
"5 Stars If You Free Chat.The Update Is So Laggy Like Bruh..Lots Of People Play It In Android, So Its Kinda New.I Like The Skins But When We Find A New Body, It Cant Even Tell Us.So Yes, I WILL Add 5 Stars If You Free Chat"
This game is so cool and fun and amazing and easy to make and it was just so bad ernesto poor didnt get a chance to play with the game and he was a bit of a hit
Im rating this 15 stars because you need to go through a complicated website JUST to be able to change your name.
"Absolutely bad. The game used to be so fun to interact with people and then yall just had to go ahead and ruin the game with the chat update.

The game used to be so fun to interact with people and then yall just had to go ahead and ruin the game with the chat update. Cant say anything not predetermined,  and makes it hundreds of times of less fun and enjoyable,  and more difficult to go about the objective of the game,  which is literally to communicate with people. Hate to see when a company or person has it good and then screws themselves over like this,  Im just incredibly disappointed. So much potential gone to waste"
It was an amazing game until this update . I rather the old version because this new version is a big NO
Good game but can be a little laggy at times
I would give thes game a 1010 because this game makes my day and my sisters day thanks innersloth keep on the good work and please add maps.
I loved this game until the update the chat..good I hateit because you cant say what you want to say
good game ever on pc but we cant ssend message on chat so improve it
It always disconnects from the server fix this plz in every mobile i play among us it will sure it will disconnects 
Kinda getting trashed on by all the people doing dumb roleplaying other than that its a goodish game.
It would be a best game if where wasnt a hacker called sire sirol.but the most awful thing is it take more 62 mb and its like so bad thats why I can say its worst game ever but I player it alot thats why 4    
It does not that you listen to music while youre playing the game thats why I gave it four stars but the rest is good
This is a really nice game but they say really mean stuff to you sometimes still its five stars this is such a good game 
Very cool and amazing app that is for free ). You should add friend requests though  
"This app was good, but yesterday im playing amongus someone hacking my amongus and now my Instagram cant log in ("
This game is just wonderful....I mean I just love it...all updates are amazing...So that is why I rate 5 stars
I love this game but when I sign in it says I need a guardian then update really didnt do much but Im triggered about how I cant change my name but I need to sign in order to change it but it still says I need a guardian please remove this and put the old hats for free and the maps are cool I hop...Full ReviewI love this game but when I sign in it says I need a guardian then update really didnt do much but Im triggered about how I cant change my name but I need to sign in order to change it but it still says I need a guardian please remove this and put the old hats for free and the maps are cool I hope you make more
Every update makes this game worse and now they are just auto banning people if you get too many reports. Even if you email them they dont have a clue why people are banned. But yet there are still so many hackers and toxic kids that dont get banned...
It is interesting game but we have wait for people and problem with chat we want like periverious update
"Nice game ,  this games needs more updates ,  new maps etc )"
Very very bad. The Game was better before but after thosenew features it is the worst it does not allow what we want to covey and we always lose I dont like it at all I Rate this 0 absolutely 0

This is dumb of you and quick chat is murdering your game. once I found a way to get rid of quickchat,  the game is a 5 star. Its just fun when you know how to play and are competent. But with quick chat that is thrown away. Dont improve it,  remove it"
"I say,  this app is the best I mean,  its way too amazing Playing with other people makes it even more attractive. Innersloth updates this app and are just cool Install this app,  please"
"I have a request ,  please can you add a mode where we can play hide and seek game in among us .... Please please please"
It was fun but when the chat changed so uou cant talk normal can you delete the chat update please if you can or not
If you ask me which game is best Ill say its among us. I love this game.And its new colours are very good.
i cantwrite anything and this is sooo anoying.i loved this game before because you could tpe before but now in the ew update you cant talk and i hate this feature
Too good game but after update i can only quick chat in pc its so hell annoying
Worst game more boring game in the planet.I think that COC and FREE FIRE is better than among us..........Please dont make game like this and dont waste our data and storage 
This new update will not let me join a game with my family. It keeps saying that the room is on quick chat and mine is set for free chat or quick chat. What does that even mean
I get that people are mad about the new chat sistem but have you seen what people would type before They type curse words lots of inappropriate things so please dont hate they just dont want the community to be toxic 
Hey man this game will be number one if you put voice chat but yeah it is a great game peace out
Great game but to talk to theres would be typing not the words to chose from
I like amoung us but the reason I gave it 3 stars is because if we wanna play we have to sign in idk why guest only get options that isnt fair to me
Now I love this app more color more people and that last update when we have to pick worlds you can still do that but you can chat as well
U cant chat it take time to load Like lots has change i wish this apk didt change i mean i cant text wat a shame game but why
This game is great i like this game its fun. Other people are playing this game too. Keep the updates coming innersloth i like the updates
"I had gave 5 stars straight in 2020 that time i cant appreciate with mouth its so interesting,  but now the new update suck s yeah, boring its not at all useful rn,  i better be uninstalling it now. Ruined a beautiful game"
Super I like very much because its very interesting to play this one of my favorite game we can play with friends also I have also played with my friends they also tell me its a good game thank you for this game
It would be good but I cant type on my own anymore I have a option of words to say and that made me not play the game anymore
cant seem to update. takes the whole day but still saying pending
"I need help,  i cant play online,  its just loading for infinite time,  Im not saying its the games problem,  but maybe you can help me"
It use to be fun but quick is killing among us so please change it to free chat again
"You ruined the whole game. Its changed completely and I liked it better in 2020. Id give a zero if I could,  it just isnt fun anymore."
This is dissapointing. The new update really just ruined the chat and the scren gliches and blacks out on one half on mobile. PLEASE among us developers FIX THE CHAT BECUASE IT SUCKS
I dont care what you say I love this game its so fun I star playing at 211 an and then I check the time again its 312 pm its a time waster I love it I recommend it if you want to make friends
"I wish the chat section had not changed,  then we had more evidence to prove our point"
When a new map is finally released Ill change my rating. At this point there better be 3 new maps or the game will die after a month. Update Havent played yet but they actually did something new lol

I cant even enjoy the game cause I cant finish a match.
This game was a classic but ever sense they made the new update it has made the game boring.
"To be honest,  i used to like this game until they added to many unessesary updates,  espetaly the other update"
These game is just a stupid game it is not so fast. And after 2to3 days we cant play this some problems comes.
This is the best game ever  I like the new update but I complain for the chat pls make the old chat . Pls .
I love the new colors and my favorite hat is the zipper hat Should we try a bunny ears Its just going to be cute I thought. Or the maid head band
Great game I really wish you could add eevee evolution hats Great game really cool
It is a good game to relieve stress about crewmates and their tasks imposter and their hiding so I rate 100100
I love you story but the more you play it gets a bit boring but except for that I love it
Great game but i hope that they remove that quick chat we cant ask que like why how etc
Plzz plzzz we are not happy with the update where the chats of our own words disappeared  . We are so incapable and powerless . Crewmates vote those who just reported
Fixed the chat and now 15 people with new tasks. No more 1 star for you...for now
Game is not good anymore like why do u have to sign in just to talk like thats saying we have to pay 50 dollars just to walk or eat so please bring the old among us back please il give a five star if u do
I really like this game but the thing it that everyone now can hack it ..so it makes a mess in thr game
I used to like the game however quick chat is here and its sit im not gonna lie its just boring i miss where we could speak and say hi to people those were good time 
Great game but the quick chat was hard at first do I have give stars
"Yeah it frustrates me now,  not just the changes but the game in general It used to be praised because it was great,  but now I completely understand why people hate it"
I love the game it if half of my screen wasnt black while Im moving in the game I wish people dont knows just stop judging my nickname favorite games that I love to create custom nickname and now cant download the game
i used to love this game. but the chat thing really ruined it.
Good game very nice gameplay but I dont like quick chat
Very fun and you should add a detective to investigate the crime Ang get clues
Back in 2020 I loved how I could do everything normally but now I cant even protect myself when Im the killer I cant write anything anymore and its annoying.
I hate how they changed it so you cant just Wright in the chat and your cant pick your names anymore so please change it back.
"Among us trying to be rated for everyone,  game used to be fun but no longer."
This game is nice but.. its chat is ver confusing for me tho its has Me Noone and I and we cant change my name and I give it 2 stars 
I love it Just needs bug fixes but after that its pretty fun
I liked it when it came out but the safetys chat is a bit annoying
Whats wrong with online Its not working We can play local only
Its an ok game but after you your tasks there is nothing else to do but other than that its an ok game
It works and safe btw thanks for the update but something going when i move it lags well I can still play
The game wont play everytime I get in the app it just gets out I tried so many time but nothings happening I would not recommend this game to anyone 
The game is nice but now its worst because of the quick chat
I love it but not enough colours hats and skins maybe next week we can have a update
This game is awsome but chatting is very difficult
nice game but when i am playing in pc it is too hard but it is ok
I like the game but sometimes I just randomly disconnect
Great game fun with friends and random good game also props to people who played this before it was cool
I think everythings great but I hate the chat its so hard I barely cant find things properly I can even say GG Or Hi Its just not good if u change the chat back where u can type then I will definitely give u a 5  review thx
I really like this game but free chat is close we have to login please innersloth creators open free chat without login please
I mostly play this game. But one problem is 3 imposters among 15 you have make 5 imposters among 15.
Great it got fixed after update just to do a simple sign in and setup amd we csn play freely like before
"Thus game is cool but can u make some updates it always stays the same,  happy summer"
This game is really good but you should fix the keyboard problem
I love the game but it lags during the game and I dont like it but other than that I like the new map
No cap this game is good but it freezing sometime but its only because I have an Android and its slow
Moving button is in bad position.

Cool game but theres still a glitch and a lot of cheaters
Best mobile game ever but i dont like new emergency meeting view.

I hate the new update I sound like a robot and I cant change my username if I dont have an accont it is stupiud pls fix this then I will give it five stars. pls fix
The reason its a 4 star is bc they disabled the part were you cant chat
BRUH this game is fun I get to be a impostor or a innocent but I can do tasks while Im ghost and sometimes if I get voted out or got killed I can just wait for impostor to win or innocent to win
Ill give this a 4 because the host keeps spaming banning people but its a good game.

"This game is now bad and boring nothing new expect for bug fixes, 15 players,  new tasks."
I love among us but 4 stars bc the quick chat is hard and i always get voted out.So for the phone players pls allow them to right like on a pc
"this game and chat is the Definition of Cancer. Servers are separated determined on name or Anime,  doesnt work properly with 5G,  Just Spam and Friends teaming. Literally only worth 1 Star I definitely do NOT recommend"
So much fun I love itthe imposter is so fun and the secrecy sells it
It was good when they realized it but now its boring because of the updates plus there are too many idiots playing now.
The new chat is worse and Im faster if I type and I cant even type the name that I want
I miss the old among us but I hate about this update is theres a loading screen before you got in game
This was game till 2019 cause in new update they changed typing system and that is very annoying
"This game was great but,  it has changed and its not the same anymore,  thank you for the great memories you gave us..."
"This game is all about interaction with other players and you guys delete whats made this a good game,  Keyboard typing."
Cant sign in for the accout sysem. Can only chat with quick chat plz change that i dont like it and its hard to coumate with.
Ok now they fixed themselfs but you get a random name and that is kind of onoing i want ro be able to make my own name as a guest
"Good game. But why did you edited those WhyWhoWhere ,  NameNameName We can write it ourselves Anyway good game"
The game sucks more when it updated because when I chat its kinda confusing pls just fix it Ill rate it 5 stars
Before Update I Very Like This Game But After Update A Stupid Quick Chat Has Been Release Please Turn On The Free Chat And Trash The Stupid Quick Chat And Please Release The Train Station Map In Among Us (Release The Train Station Map In Among Us Map
The game itself is fun but the chat update ruined it please bring the old char back Innersloth

I like the game but absolutely hate the chat I liked it before Now Its Just idiotic to put it like that
This is amazing but u can chat whatever its in the feed.
Why did I review 1 star cuz I miss the old game since u cant even pick ur own name and now chatting is kinda hard and is been awful I basically dont like this game anymore honestly
I love when I win as imply or crew Game is recommended And pis add another map and some new task (fancy task piz
"amazing app, but Updates are To Big (as in storage is big)"
Its ight fun but i prefer to roplay on there and many people do aswell os i feel like there should be a roplay catagory alond with a way to only find other roplayers depending on the fandom such as danganronpa or fnf
I wasnt able to acess the game it kept loading worst thing ever.
I rate it five because you can do mods and stuff and u can have no imposter and have all ur tasks completed  great game
How do u buy pets I want the walle thing so bad also a friend list would be great to anyone wanting to play I definitely recommend i spend hours playing also If u could bring back the mohawk that would be great thank u so much innersloth also the censorship for when u say wassssup is ridiculous fix...Full ReviewHow do u buy pets I want the walle thing so bad also a friend list would be great to anyone wanting to play I definitely recommend i spend hours playing also If u could bring back the mohawk that would be great thank u so much innersloth also the censorship for when u say wassssup is ridiculous fix if plz I got cursed at for that

This game doesnt allows to chat whatever we want please fix this problem
You should add more kitchen tasks And it lags all the time And you should add more imposter for 15 people
"Yay,  I can finally play it The chat update is a bummer but,  I can still say someone is (Sus)picious"
Fun game but sometimes boring when you dont get imposter.

I myself dont play it much,  if at all,  anymore. Id be lying however to say i didnt enjoy playing. I did. Its just lost its appeal (to me anyway). Plus the tasks are becoming monotonous."
ever since the new update its been bad you cant type your responses. The only good thing is that it allows up to 15 people now.
This game is really fun but I do not like the new quick chat feature.
it was a good game until the update that change the chatting system
New update sucks I cant type what i wanna type in the chat and I cant even change my user i dont even wanna play it anymore. Please change it back
This game is good but the problem is we dont get pet so I give only four thank you among us for the game
I wanted to play the game normally but then I noticed I couldnt change my name and I couldnt type in the chat and it was kind of lame because it thought I was a child and it wanted me to verify that I was an adult
Everything got fixed thank you innersloth can you plz try and add a feature where you can see this one is typing
"Need to put time on vote,  cause so many people afk and leave cause didnt vote."

"Horrible the new update ruins it the account,  names,  chat,  designs like WHY EVERY IS LOOSING INTREST. To the developer of the game,  do the original among us we hate the V2"
"The chat in the update is bad,  there is no way to defend yourself if youre accused. Everything else is fine though."
The games fine but the people are so cringe theres these 9 year Olds wanna date and people acting like there an actual anime character so cringy.An the adults saying cuss words.Im sorry I cant write anymore its just so cringe.
The fun game but quick chat option is just awful
I give it three stars because the new upgrade is not good at all it should be the way it was before

"Dont listen to all the low star reviews,  their all wrong. Among us always has been and always will be amazing."
i would have rated this a 5 star. but im now not able to join public servers or make servers.
Honestly I love this game but I hate that we cant chat and choose any name. Plz fix this

Some devices cant even download the update that they have inside the app."
I agree with everyone this game use to be the top 20 but now since they got the stupid update its bad WE ALL want the regular chat back
Nice But it would be better if you could choose your role(imposter or crewmate)
Old among us was great but updated version is not so good.
Very good but you have to include the mic option in game
I love being the impostor and cool maps A real mystery who is the impostor so awsome But i somtimes get stuck going up and down ladders.
Best game but enable the chats and release the submerged map in mobile
I play this game with my siblings all the time. It is so fun and easy to play with everyone
Among Us was one of the best game I have ever see I love that game but we can not right our name or right in chat hello hi anything so I didnt like that
I love this game among us but sometimes its a little glitchy
Are you still love it months ago but now its dead the developers killed it you have to freaking have a account thats stupid because I cant even play it no more cuz of that you have to spend money on it just to play
"It, s a fun game the task the pet, s everything it, s sooooooo fun"
its good but uhh i dont really like the cahts i like the old chats but i like the game if u would make the chat better i would make it 5 stars thats all 
Among us was really good until it It got updated pls change it back To how it was that why it now has 3.6 stars why did you change it ugh This is so much more harder to kill Too please change it back thanks

But Ill wait , Keep up"
This game is horrible . I recommend u to fix the chat it is so annoying I rather tipe my own thing. Fix it bc if u wont fix it then ur dumb
This game is very cool and fun I played it with my friends A boy on my side and two girls we were the imposters and we won I love this game very very much I should say a big thanks to innersloth for creating this game
Its good but can we just say what we want to say like can we chat to other people and you cant even say start hi or whatever 
Amoung us is a good game Its fun to be imposter but Sometimes the servers dont work but just sometimes.
Can never join a game with a code. I just get a black screen every time
I love this app but some times it glitches I think you should fix that but I really like everything else
This is the best game but why I give it four star Because sometimes this game is glitching
Its really fun to play but its hard to communicate with others but still its fun

I rate 4 star becouse there a bug and glitch so that it
1 thing why didnt they add new colors before
Its really fun and its virus free yuo can also play with freindsD )
The new chat is just stupid. It ruins the experience.

I really like this game But can you please give us free chat its better Also can you let us change our name Because its very boring like with random names like Lime or Eve I just want to name my self So please do it
It was great but the chat wheel is annoying
Game crashes before menu appears. The game looks fun
When I go into the game its go back to the Play store its maybe my iPad but still I will put three. Stars
Its a good game great to pass the time but so many hackers please fix this problem

If you want turn off the safe chat without guardian email Step 1 1. Delete among us 2. Download it again 3. After that go to setting  apps  Among us 3. Reset the data 4. And enjoy free safe chat
its alright but the chat thing is bad but at least there is a setting for that
Well I play this game with all my friends and cousins so it would be super fun and we would be up till like 2 in the morning playing it and at times it would be so funny just to kill ppl
Hello among us Im love the game but the chat is hard when I saw an imp I cant pronounce My words please put it back

Absolutely nothing to complain about all the content is fabulous and thats why I give it five stars.
"Can you please stop throwing me out of the game with the message you were banned for hacking I cant help it if my ping suddenly jumps to 1200 ms in the middle of the game,  and I wouldnt even know how to hack."
This game was soo good but I hate that accounts thing and the quick chat pls remove it or its duper good and know ppl said bad words but u just kinda ban those words and yeh so pls remove or 5 stars
Its hard to play on my computer because it doesnt have the key controls. So can you please make that possible for all computers.

Very entertaining no hate ti the game I love it) maybe add ehere everyone can play mods and then it will be five

Can you add submerged and new more colors please  can you make characters from videos
"It have error.When i connect to private room,  i typed correct code.But always show the messageSever disconnected..........."
I rated for star because well I like the game its just because you dont get to type in the chat freely
This game is good but the anoying part is that you cant type normally and change your NAME in the game I hate it now
"How will I play the game, if I cant even login to the game Please,  fix this error."
Ok although the game is different cuz of chat I can fix it. Delete the game reinstall it and then put you birth year as 2000 done
I like this game but it has to many ads
Please remove the quick chat and bring back the free chat we cant communicate
"Im giving this game a 3 because of the chat I would give it a 4 but the chat. The chat is horribly now,  can you please add the old chat back develepors"

Its a good game but there is one problem i am always a crewmate i have barley been an imposter
Great game all it needs is new modes maybe
It was a good game until they changed the chat function
this game is good but we cant freely talk to any body only questions and statements you have to fix this
"Good game i will give you that, but all downloader be carefull because im playing this game for about 1 weeks and that 1 week i already see about 5 hacker that can go through wall or know who is impostor so be careful for my advice just delete it and download hide and seek or something like this that...Full ReviewGood game i will give you that, but all downloader be carefull because im playing this game for about 1 weeks and that 1 week i already see about 5 hacker that can go through wall or know who is impostor so be careful for my advice just delete it and download hide and seek or something like this that have better security than this"
The best game to relax during quarantine and also the best murder mystery game
Among us is back and better than ever recommended... But do be careful people can still kick you out and ban you from their own room
It was great before they removed the ability to type what we want to say and our own names
If there were more maps and other gamemodes then the ratings will improve by 85 also please plan this for console

I love the new updtes and the new airship but i cant type what i want to type i have to choose what i want to type i need you to fix it pls or else i will give among us a [0] zero star rating
Became worse after the update. unplayable really liked this game before its too glitchy now
It is good game but if you can add friends with it it will be better
its good but many hacker can enter and ruined the game please remove all hackers..its unfair
Im always crewmate and a lot of players are noob and they dont vote at all and they love to push emergency bottom for nothing.
It was pretty terrible I couldnt even type my own sentences and got voted out five times in a row because of it
"Ever since the safe chat was added,  talking in game is not even possible."
the maps are so cool but not being abe to change name or type in chat is lame

Your game sucks. Worst game ever. I try to play with my friends but it says Could not find the game your looking for. I had enough WHY I hate u
Great game to play with friends when youre bored.
"I used to play this a ton,  but now people are using it as a way to find people for nudes. Because of this,  since I re downloaded I have only played 2 games all the way through"
I love this game but the quick chat is hard for me
It is a good game but it would be better if there was a friending system
the game in general is fun but i dont like the way i move around being on a chromebook and i dont like the new chat update
"I liked the 1st version of the game but now that they updated it,  its not really fun anymore."
Its a really good game but theres hardly any surver but if there is u just get kicked out of it
They fix the bugs art everything its perfect
"Horrible,  its got worse I use to love this game untill it got popular. Its changed dont get this game save yourself. its bad"
I like this game it was really nostalgic playing it in awhile but PLEASE let us chat again(excuse me if this is a post is a little rude)
Very good and well startigik game but needs voice chat also
The fact that u cant chat anymore ruined it I hate it now but is used to be fun
Its good and i like the updates in this game i love this game so much but i dont like the chat update
I HATE THE NEW UPDATE i used to love how u could text ur own statments but now they choose for u its so annoying

"I like among us... but you cant chat like before update,  i need before update chat. I like among us because I can be Impostor."

"I love the game but,  I want to change my name and also I really want to chat whatever we want. I love the maps but pls allow us do to these features"
Really really fun to play if you can add a new map I would like it.
This game is so boring when you are crew mate.make some changes make it more creative.
Oh yes when I want to play with someone it does not work I change settings and I restart and I does not work but even do its a good game

This game is the best but two reason when someone calls meeting you cant vice chat and You cant talk to the impostor to make a plan pls fix that

I like it in android but not in PC cuz of the update of the quick chat
the auto chat just ruines it tbh i think its kinda pointless as we cant fully chat or defend our self about the murder and the imposter im really upset used to be better befor
"Since update I can not type in the chat,  NY key board will not pop up"
It is cool and addictive but its addiction is allways managable.
Innersloth please let us type whatever please and just remove the option to unfilter the chat. Ill be waiting.
I wold have gave it 5 stars but its because i cant type in chat.
This a fun game but i played first time i disconnect from server
This game is the bestD is so much fun I play this with my sister jazz and I give this a 5 star review
No all problems solve and i hear that new map is coming is that fake news or right news
This game is great but turn off quick chat
A very good like this game so much I like to become crewmate and imposter .
I was confused at first with the chat but you have to go to settings and change chat.
Before I had gave 5star it was a good game now they just messed it up its done for they could make it better again. Whos with me on makeamongusbetter

"It aint working ,  whenever am there it just says ,  the app has stopped working"
Very good game I recommend if you like murder mystery type stuff.
We cant custom talk anymore this sucks...  also we all hate this update you better fix all this...  thats the reason I hardly play your game 
The game is still a good game can you just fix the chat please
This game is so fun And if u be imp that will be extra fun must dowland

Very fun but after the update the restrictions are annoying
Hey innersloth the reason why I rated two stars is because yall made the chat very hard to navigate and it became very limited.
If innersloth made an option to choose quick chat and free chat for not logged in people It will be rate more than 3
Everytime I join a lobby I cant even play because it bounces me out of the lobby
I like the new changes but theres one Can you type your own this like you wanna say orange teleport and u cant plsss fix that

(Ps) I have now removed a star from the review because of the chat update. I understand its purpose,  but Id just like a setting or something added so that you could turn it off."
"OMG,  I really like this game I had never play thought of a game like this so much fun pls if You saw this review just installed the among us game  bye"
It is good but the new quick chat option is terrible
Best game ever but Im giving 4 stars because of quick chat please remove quick chat
The best game ever in the world it is my favourite game ever it has a lot if cool features innersloth keep it up
Quick chat mode is very bad please fix it
It is good but to have to make an account and prove your over 18 to free char amd change ypu gamertag is a little insane for a childs game
It was good for a long time but then it just got worse and worse... but now its gotten better again so well see how long that lasts I guess
Sucks and it is rigged and wants access to your account. Pleas bring old Among us. The I will give 5 stars
I love it Makes sense my phone was the problem. )
I like among us but the changes were horrible the first time play ing it was a good game but If you have an among us Account it not that bad
It disconnects easily and the players lie.
I dont understand why so many people hate this game even if it has glitches its a game and its made by people people make mistakes.Lets just support this game.Btw I know I wrote most of the words wrong just chill.
I hate new update U cant even type ur in chat it was so good in the og days 3 maps 10 people max Custom names No sign in I wantnthe old one back I hate this new one
it was good but now It keeps saying Im aged 5 but Im WAY older than that so I cant play with my friends
Still not able to chat. New upgrade nerfed everything. I cant use the chat feature. I tried to reinstall (which didnt fix it) and now I cant get my name back. Guess I wont be playing this game anymore. Hard to win when you cant defend yourself in chat.
Enjoyable gameplay and very well designs.
Remove quick chat option. It completely ruined the game.
It was fun until I downloaded the update now the game wont even open seriously dont update the game.
Very good game until they changed the chat mechanics
nice game but it hink it should be 3D
In first there was good chat we can write anything but now we cannt write wht we want so i will gove this only 1 star and when you will do like first then i will put 5 stars on you but i am playing because i want like what first was or i will delete it and i will give it 1 star
Among Us Is A nice Game But I dont Like it When it Glitchs In The Gap Room Players Glitch In Left Bottom Corner
I love it. I listen to all of the among us songs and I love it I give it a five star rating just love it I always play it
Guys please help me this game is not even walking when it loads it just goes back
The game is good just please let us type in the chat the new chat is so stupid
its a really good game but you must veryify your email to say oiginal things or make a name thats original (just a warning) its rlly good tho i recomend it
It used to be amazing but now u cant even choose ur name or text anything horrible
My game is still not working...I updated new version among Us...but still Im on black screen..

As I cannot understand the chat settings. I wouldve given it 5 stars but this thing is a problem. Now Im happy to say that Im able to use free chat instead of quick chat. Thanks Innersloth.
Ive been playing this game for awhile and I would like to say thank you to the people who worked on this project and keep going. Also keep the negative away. 
I hate the new update i already give my email and it doesnt work there is no notification from among us in my email
When among us came out i didnt have problems but now i cant even join a game then my screen truns black
Fun but also got kicked from 1 game and banned from 1 for doing nothing wrong
New way to chat is GARBAGE. It was much better before.
Its only loading I cant play I havent play one time also in new version

I Love Among Us because of the update a lot and play it with random people in lobby with them
I just hate this app so much doesnt let me play just because its asking for my email and its just I dont know how to do that is I just hate this game so much just for that one single thing I really wanted to play this game but it just doesnt
I like tobplay this game in 2020 but after April 2021i dont like this game much because we need to add email and now we cant even put are own message
This game have 5 to 10 players and being the Imposter and cool names thats why I like this game.
Fix your game. After the last update I cant connect..

But since the new Airship update the games quality for me has really just plummeted. Making an account is so aggravating. The fact that you cant chat nor choose a name seems just pointless. Its essentially impossible to play without. I would not reccomend anymore,  and will not be playing until the next update."
I love the new update And it has a few new colors it is gray my favorite
Well I have wondering why many people did not like today so um I found out that this update is well not good for kids pls let kids chat too in the game so they can have fun thx... (Didnt like the update cause Im a 8 year old boy
When i start game my mobile screen turns black although my device is good
I like this game a lot it was my favorite game but does a lot of hackers that why I put it on.4
Game is good but we need voice chat in friendly created games
"Bring back the freechat , the game is not fun anymore with the new quick chat"
Among us is a really fun game for 10 year olds to take advantage of this
I think its a good game but it was better when it didnt have that update i wish it didnt update but its still a good game.
"At first,  I thought the game was so fun until the new updates came and the chat is different. Everytime I say who the imposter is no one belives me BECAUSE I CANT WRITE"
It has bring the chat back I like it.. now its a lot better 
I love this game but I dont really like the account thing but still 5 stars and sorry for short review I dont know what to say sooo ya.
super fun you can play with your friends but theres one thing that I hate you know the map of polis why is there a White among Us person behind the toilets
I liked the servers is the chat the gameplay theme account and age I dont liked
Ok fun. Theres not much to do after the first 20 games its all the same after awhile. Not to bad .
Why does this app always say the you where disconnect thats not good no one gets to play
I just want a way to report people who ban for no reason. Perfect game though.
Hate the new chat feature makes the game very boring to play .. plz jus remove the new chat feature
innersloth please add a new map i herd you and 5up make the submerge map and please and a new map like to moon map new task and new rooms and new colors 5 of them like baby blue and gold and silver and dark red and magenta please add them please 
I love this game new chat make all things easy anyone can say you anythings so good new room is also very good love this game
i love this game but i dont like this update. i cant chat or play with my friends. (
Its a very good game could use improvement lots of lag
Can not play with other ppl on apple device because of version difference.
This game used to be fun and all but I think you have to make a account and get your parents email to type in the chat _ this game sucks
Is so hard to use the chat in the game I cant understand nothing Hard to use
THE GAME IS VERY FUN AND ALOT OF JOY BUT ALOT OF TASKS WITCH ARE VERY COMPLIACTED.
"The chat was not removed guys,  you only have to sign in to use the free chat."
Right game I choose  no problem only one thing is there hacker will come then we can not play but it is nice 
I want to give a five star but it always updates in the new updates are kind of not updated it was better before i dont need to want to give five star can you guys dont please give me a lot of
"This game is amazing,  if only they were mods in the game,  that will be lit."
Very fun for kids who like mystery and finding out crimes
The reason I say rate I a 3 is they made it where you cant talk cant make your own name please make where you can talk and make you own name
"Whenever I play it ,  I love it but the network is very bad so I cannot play nicely"
Age update is unplayable still love the game tho Edit sorry back to 5 star didnt see settings

i had it as a 5stargame before all the new updates it glitches alot and wont let even pick my name and it wont let me type probolly
selecting and chating optaion is bad. Custom chat is best

"I cant get an account,  I dont have Google play games,  and Google play games is unavailable for my device until they update it. )"

"Jees,  its 2021,  and we have 5 maps. Skeld,  MIRA Hq,  Polus,  Airship,  and,  Submerged. Good work Keep on going"
"I like da updates and killer. And My favorite task is clean vents, hamburger kitchen airship"
Tbh in this game if one glitch is gone then another glitch comes Like seriously
The app was great at first until you updated it. Ive to change review because I the app is working..............
I love among us the only problem is that sometimes I disconnect when I am on WiFi I dont get why this happens. Another thing is the chat I get that people used to swear in it but u could just tag it out instead of making it so much more difficult to use. But other than that it is great
Before the new update it was 5\5 but now it is 0\5 because you cant chat freely or pick your name dont download this game
The update ruined the game I would like to be able to type things again

"Best game in this world,  Ill highly recommend everybody to install it ) and enjoy"
"The game is almost unplayable. The reason I say that is because all of the my hero academia fans are making lobbies with the names of the my hero characters,  and they ban everyone who doesnt have a my hero name. Please ban my hero names. The fatherless children are so annoying."
COME BACK OLD AMONG US. Just update to Free Chat and Free name it look like old among us Please.

4 stars because they removed the chat even tho it was good to remove it cause some people would talk rude
Now a days its not working they are showing we couldnt find the game you are looking for
Game got disconnected multiple times even younhad good network connectivity
Why do we have a report button if it doesnt work if i report a hacker cause not everyone is going to report the same hacker or the hacker switch names or dont have one because now things aint easy

I like this game but the new map update i see just purple i dont know why but besides that its a good game
The best multiplayer game...amazing bgm and thrilling scenarios
Terrible you should not have updated it and u shouldve let people still type in chat now they have to let a stupid type thing speak for them
It has no ads and thats pretty Sweet
This game is now completely ruined with hackers and chat.Before update my favorite game was among us But after update I feel worlds worst game ever Fix this please then my again favorite game will be among us
why cant i just use freechat without a guardian email it makes sense it makess it harder to talk and longer i dont like it please change this i just dont get it
Im too lazy to write 162 paragraphs of how good this game is and make a poem out of it so Ill say its very enjoyable and I def reccomend.
Why are it 1 because when I wanna play tells me your disconnected from the server sent 6 pings that remote has not responded to  the worst game ever  you need to read the reviews to know the best  the worst 
The game was good but a update made it bad u cant chat anymore  its bad so pls get rid of new update
The downloading of additional assets is taking a too long to download ......... I already waited for one DAY and its not DONE yet
Very very bad new update no changes and we have to loginn

"I dont like the fact that you have to make an account to be able to talk,  but other than that the game is fine"
This game is bout finding the murder. Fun to play even offline.
I mean its okay but after waiting since August for the new submerged map coming out and I never seen it
I dont like when you cannot chat and the players not voting fast
it was a good game before its update then i spent five dollars on it and now it wont let me sign back in the game is trash now because of its parental block
Bring back the old chat the new one is horrible.

Everyone should have the right to talk freely and if you (Innersloth) are afraid of people say inappropriate language,  set up a banning system where people get banned for... you know what.

Its cool I love it. Four stars cause there should be a imposter chat

Especially for when Im doing Hide and Seek,  the seekers will just kill me right there and I have nothing to do about it. Even for the Seekers it would be annoying since they couldnt kill anyone."

Cant even install it. It downloads some additional content forever.
what is wrong with the chat option...literally this game went from top to zero
"So basically,  is asking for my personal information in order to play.... ummm I am not a minor,  I dont understand why I need to go through all of this,  this update was definitely not it. I dislike this game and wont play it again,  unless someone helps me get my occount back.."

I hope that the host of the game reads this review and fixes the problems and I cant see my character,  its always dark. Thank you )"
This game sucks you know why first I down load the game its worth it but now it cant load
It was good but somtimes when ik try to join one itll say like 415 and itvsaid the game was full. Pls fix that
I cant type anymore which is hard so I decided to uninstall then install again to see if it works
"Among us kind of sucks now,  Because you have to do a verification process now. And the verification process could lead to identity fraud."
"Used to be a good game,  but with the updates,  is not fun any more"
"I love this game,  next update add spectating when you die"
So this game is best of play entertainment and graphics is also nice and we have 4 maps to play and so nice game so I give him to 5 star

The game is ruined now because we cant type freely and thats super annoying
"The new update has kinda ruined some things,  i miss the old ipad and things look so,  different,  it doesnt even look like the old game anymore,  but some of the new features are nice to have like controller and keyboard support,  and the new map is nice,  but i miss alot of the old stuff.

Very funny Among Us i just started playing the game and all i encountered was 3 cheating persons communicating with each other to harrass people and calling them stupid and making children cry here i hope you fix this toxicity by having a ban policy or actually make your report option good

Its a nice and simple game that you can pick up easily. I love how diverse all the maps are,  like how you go from the small Skled to the gigantic Airship. With the latest update now up to 15 people in one match and theres more colors I love this game and I want to keep seeing it progress into bigger things"
I give it 5 starts cuz its an online amazing game where u could search for the imposter and help the others or got killed and do ur tasks to win our can also be the killer and lie at the others u guys should install that game

It is or was a fun game I hate the speech restrictions and how you need to have a account.

I try joining games NOPE. Chatting Nope. I need to put my credit card NO WAY Horrible yes.
I like the new updates but I wish you could type freely on mobile.
This game is good but I play on iPhone and when I want to play on my android I cant play on my iPhone account I have to play on a new one which means I cant play with my skins or pets do you know what I can do
I like the game but its hard to to talk with the update for the chat
The game just keep crashing and it very annoying would not rate the app

"After update everything is fine except chat,  and I really lost interest . We cant chat anything"

Its so fun to play if people are saying bad wirda just ban them ans if you cant ban then report or say the host to ban them if the host is saying bad words leave and join another lobby its fun and easy
I love this game but now you cant explain yourself thanks to autochatwhcih kinda ruined it pls get rid of the auto chat
I think that the game is good but the 1problem with it is that for some reason it rest so that is what I like and dont like

Overall Its a good game. EDIT Thx for the update thing,  really appreciate it"

Now Im sure I pressed both buttons but there is a small chance I could have missed it but these updates still do suck."
I cant do anything this game it need to sign in but I use my code it wont let me in is the worst game ever. I want the old game back.I will delete this game

Nice but the pets need real money and I am 11year old kid

You cant change your name or write in the chat without putting your card PIN after your parents permission.

"The game was AWESOME before the update. You cant say what you want in the chat,  they just give you options for what to say and its VERY confusing. You cant even choose your name The game is literary trash and not fun if you update it. UPDATE If you sign in it works"

Please bring back the old version of among us. The new version isnt fun at all.
Fun new update looked cool but it ruined the game you cant type and now I hate it
Super game I love it very much plz do as mini crewmate give as free so we will give u 5 star and enter our own name and in investigation typing method on old amoung us we love it so plz do all things I say so I will gave u 5 stars other wise the is very good
I love among us now because if you sign in so you can play free chat now I love it very much best game ever
Omg I hate this game sooooo much because when I open the game in my tablet E7 and it crash I hate this game so much 
I really like but.. there was a problem i can t be a imposter Kinda like crewmate curse bring back the no name glich

But I suddenly cant even sign in my account and it always says failed,  error and mismatch userIDs and such everytime I tried to sign in. Now I cant enjoy playing because I couldnt change my name,  cant talk in chat,  cant even load the maps properly,  especially the Airship one."
This is the best game so far but you need something with this game and know what it is the gun for the crewmate or make imposter bigger because they have knife pls

It makes the only fun thing being imposters since crew cant give quick responses and have to navigate the useless quick chat. My advice play on voice chat with friends. Only way you can play effectively now. Get a account to actually play. Then its fun again

A couple of times Ive been told I have to wait 5 minutes for an intentional disconnect when it was a random disconnect. Several instances of being frozen in place or seeing someone disappear (not venting,  just disappearing) .

This game is so good but before it was we write chat our self and we kept our name with our chose so plz make this before so it was like again i was just enjoy my favorite game plz plz

"A lil good no more bad words,  online dater,  but the update is kind of anyone WOULD LIKE THE UPDATE IF THE CHAT"
What they did to the game made it worse you cant speak freely thats my mine problem. I want to be able to speak what I wanna say
I miss the old chat its not fun anymore because I cant relly say who the imposter is no fun give us old chat back allso when mean words are said  them
This game used to be so fun until the latest update. I cant join a lobby coz I need to sign in to Google Play and when I do it says there was an error. I have to use stupid names now too. And no one can say what the have to say in time and then gets booted off.

its amazing but the developers made it hard to play for us huawei users because we cant make an account
"getting out of match at the begining of the game ,  fix ur 6 ping error plsss"
I know u guys worked really hard on this new update but I wish u guys would put it back how it was. I like it better the old way. Sorry.
It is fun but I wish they put a spy in the game to help the Crew mates out

I contacted the among us team several days ago and they said they would look into the issue but nothing has been fixed. I just want to get back to playing the game.

Just uninstall it then reinstall,  then when they ask you for you date of birth and year,  just but it before 2000 or you can put 2000. But not later than that Then go to the settings then there will be option of data. There chose the type you want Thats it Love"
"This game is soo unfair i was playing the game a about one hour straight and not once did i get to become the imposter,  everyone gangs up on you and you cant even make your own name without signing in that ridicules."
I really like the game and I have a question when will there will be a update on one of the maps like I dont mean a new map just some thing on the old maps.
The original version was great but after they made the changes it sucked.
Its a good game but the quick chat ruined it...
I would give this a five. But no one like the safe chat plz take it off. And just make it to where if you say a bad word it blocks it and stays that way
I like the game but it would be better if we got to chat by ourselves and we can send friend requests

Enjoying the 15 crew setting. The only update Ive had an issue with is being able to change amount of imps in lobby,  which makes the search function for amount of imps useless now. I really only like 1 imp games (though 23 imp in 15 player games is okay now),  and search for that,  but keep ending up in lobbies for 2 or 3 imp because of that change"
Hope the chat is original because its hard to use chat like that....
great game but really should bring back the chat

"Great game but has issues. It keeps skipping and lagging. I try and move over to a vent,  and I keep going over. It literally keeps screwing me over. I also cant move well since it skills a whole lot of frames,  so I wind up all over the place. Thats my biggest issue."

Its extremely awkward and the touch controls are no good because your finger or stylus covers a portion of the screen. I propose an idea implement an 8Directional gamepad overlay option like a DPad. That could help a lot mobilitywise.
For those who read reviews please dont blame among us that much but blame the parents of the kids who saw people cursing on the app and said lets complain to among us creators.
The update sucks. Its no longer to free chat. Please back to old among us.

"This is a really good game but recently Ive figured out that when I go to find online matches,  it only gives me (max) 5 or (min) 0 servers to choose from. I know very well that theres more than that Cmon guys,  what happened"
"It was a fun game,  but they removed the chat (you can only pick from a few prewritten lines) and you cant even customize your username anymore. Ruined most of the fun. Reinstalled it after not playing for awhile,  but now Im deleting for good."
What did you (developers) do with the game Now it suck We cant free chat
I LOVED it but I cant play it anymore because I got black screen problem
Your ruined the whole game. The chat thingy is so annoying.

Tired of Hacks. Yall need to fix your game so the coding is not hackable Im sick of being in lobbys and having someone Immediately call out who is imposter because they have an infantile hack to detect who is imposter

I think it is kinda dont like it how you cant type and say what you want but I will still play it.

This game is way better than murder mystery because you dont have to wait around for the murderer to show themselves. Although the game has a lack of diverse content and it gets repetitive. Maybe if innersloth added the ability to create custom modes it might be better.

Innersloth plz fix these issues and Ill give your game a 5 start rating.
I like the game but the is to hard. You have to ubdet the game
Please add support for up to 120fps on phones and please add controller support
I love this game its amazing but i am giving this a 2 star because of the update. I love the new colors but i hate the new thing where you have options to tell (text) people. Its super anoying. I would play this all the time but now i just hate it ( plz change the keyboard option
great if can not free chat login with gogle play
"Absolutely impossible to play with any type of color deficiencies,  especially with the new update and added colors. It was bad before even with the addition of color blind updates that did nothing to help. But now with the added colors its even worse. Not even worth attempting to play anymore."
This game is fun and all but my only prolbom is that if you dont sing in we cant free chat
"Ok,  I though the changes is very terrible but actually its not,  all you need to do is sign in to google play( which I have one ) then I can play freely,  free chat,  change my name,  and so much more. . . I can now play this game without restrictions so 5 again. . . Btw I really enjoy the new map."

Now I can defend myself against accusations without it taking more precious little time . That and the ability to report someone has worked like a good luck charm . Trolling has died down since now they can be reported instead of just getting back into their former lobby or joining another . Im just glad that the game is playable again ."
This game is amazing. After the new update i cant write explanation nor anything. I can only use system texts which takes dozens of minutes to find. I deleted the app. When you make the chat same as it was before ill be there to download it.

I love among Us  for people who cant spell words I like their guide for that but you cant say what you want to say love saying gg but now you cant say that you cant even type Please fix this problem but good job 
Its great but the update of the chat and name is annoying.
This is good but new update is good to but some r bad I just want to say this is a good game 
Im one of the users who played this game before it would become popular. Back then I was really enjoying the game but now its full of new weird updates which make me confused everytime so I dont feel like playing this game again. For the old version I would give 5stars.

And there are so many glitchesI would give 0 stars if I could.
"People saying they cant chat are stupid,  you have to go to settings and turn chat settings to quick chat and free chat. If you cant change it,  YOU HAVE TO MAKE AN ACCOUNT. You change your name from the settings page too now,  which is kinda annoying,  but now you know where to find it."

I dont like your new update your game is the worst it keep disconnecting me
"You really gotta get rid of having to sign in,  I cant talk to anyone anymore and its annoying."
The airship is too big and unbalanced In the future if you make more maps make them more balanced
Im sorry but the update was horrible. I usually role play on this app and now its just unplayable now. The chat has completely change and the game just isnt really fun anymore cuz of it. Im sorry I had to be one of those people to complain but I feel it need to be addressed.

"Get rid of the ban option,  its impossible to join a game with out getting instantly banned."
This game is amazing You get too do tasks if your crewmate and if your imposter than you do fake tasks and kill people. Which means it is not for everyone which is fine. The reason I took of a star is becase you dont get to pick your name which is annoying. But otherwise great game

I have met so many cool people on here but Im not going to give out my phone number or social media. I just wish there was another way to keep the people that we played with. And if you get kicked from a game due to internet,  the only way to go back to the people you had been playing with is to write the code down. So if you dont do that then you can never play with those people again."
Its a fun game to play but its now kinda hard because at first I couldnt find the chat and people stay quiet and they voted out people that are not it and we cant chat as good I think you should put back the free chat and I cant really defend my self so I get voted out if you can please put the...Full ReviewIts a fun game to play but its now kinda hard because at first I couldnt find the chat and people stay quiet and they voted out people that are not it and we cant chat as good I think you should put back the free chat and I cant really defend my self so I get voted out if you can please put the free chat that will be amazing But pls do something about it its pretty boring me and my friends use to play it but now we dont bc its hard and you cant find the exact words you want to say 
"i have some complaints (1) pets cost money (2) code for the private servers never work,  can you send join requests,  or friend people (3) also the new update. I dont like how it needs to acess all your account details. Its stupid,  it was great before the update,  Do not play. "
"There needs to be more chat control,  not just limits to what people can say,  but whether or not people can be reported for what they say.

My favourite game is among us But please update this app for free chat and some technical issue

But y dont u use it this wen the players use the words you can ban them plz.
I love this game a lot But the only thing I would change is the chat it is nothing like how it used to be. You used to be able to text anything you wanted but now its super strict. It only lets you text what they pick out. (
Super good but when i play among us at 1 o clock am its dark when join public games

This game used to be fun but now its the worst game ever it doesnt let me join if I put in the code one star worst game ever
I like the update but my problem is the chat message we cant even type
"Changed my mind,  Yall have killed the fun in among us since the new update of convisaion bring back the old fun in among us."

This game is nice but the one thing I dont like about it is you have a choice of words on what to say theres no typing allowed thats why I rate this game 4 stars and please I want the the creators of among us to put an no visor mod or any other cool mod

Its a good game and all but it got boring after you cant type your own words and have to use suggested words (dont know if im the only one with this problem).

I love this game but from today its not starting. I mean if I create a lobby it doesnt shows the number of players and if I click the start button the game doesnt starts. Its really annoying. I think theres a glitch or bug in the game or maybe some other technical issues. You should fix it.
Its a good game but can the game have the old talking
"Lag so bad,  looking for room is incredibly difficult"
I love it but theres hackers in it like sire soral and Eric lork and impostrs like Henry and mur3y So be careful.....

There is a map that is is similar to the admin map and you can see where other players are and when death occurs.

"Game is still good,  having some Razor Kishi issues though... sometimes the buttons dont do what they are suppose to do like the map button and settings button. They work fine in main menu but in game it just makes it revert to touch screen till I release the button. Its weird"
"I love Among Us. Its such a good game. I just think that it has so much potential. Like more roles,  (Like a sherif) modes,  and a way to escape death but it is very hard to do. In conclusion,  I think its time for a big update."
"The game doesnt work with me The updated version is terrible I cant even play,  it keep telling me to update it but it doesnt work Youre the worst A star is more than you deserve"
"I love this game. The update is awesome and everyone is starting to come back to Among Us. New colors,  15 players max,  the airship map,  the newest vent clean task and the way the buttons look now all make it better Please play this game. Its so good."
I am sorry innersloth I used to love this game so much but now........just because of not able to be changing our name my friends also dont like the game anymore and because of the account which have to get......
do you know about the text that said Was this a dead body or an emergencey meeting no one can reply because it doesnt say dead body in the chat and it doesnt say emergencey meeting in the chat so quick chat is the wost thing ever and sadly i dont have the clean the vents task.
I used to enjoy this game so much. But i absolutely hate the update. Whoever thought of the new chatting systen should be fired. The game isnt as enjoyable anymore because we cant communicate properly. Please change this back to how it was before.

This game was very good at first. Since the update has come...the vision is very weird and I am not able to see anything. This game is deteriorating and am not happy with this game anymore. So uninstalling it. )
Good game Im kinda sad it died after the YouTubers stopped playing it Its a good game 5 stars
Why do i need an account with a parent email . Game used to be good and now its trash stop listening to sensitive snowflakes.Cant even find a game or host one.
"When I first downloaded the game,  it worked great. Now after the airship update,  I cannot play a game and when Im finally able to get in,  I cant type. I always have a server has disconnected message. Its so frustrating."
"I love the game and play on PC a lot,  but I notice when I play on mobile that the cheating is out of control. After the first round theres almost always someone who instantly calls out both imposters. Bad cheating issue in the game."
It keeps kicking me out of the game when I try to play it on my phone
"This game is not the same anymore. People are literally turned it into a dating app. Theyre using names like single18,  needbf singlegirl. You need to fix this."
This is just terrible. Each update just makes it worse. Among Us used to be awesome. Now it sucks. I am uninstalling
"It will not let me sign in this is so frustrating. I have tried lots of times,  still can not,  please help me."

"Ok,  the update is absolutely amazing. Lots of things have been fixed and till now its going pretty great. I love it. The colours are new,  more people in the loby,  new reporting system,  and the new outlet of the meeting and everything,  it is pretty cool."
Amazing how skins you already had equipped get deleted and put up on sale.
"This game is hard to play on a phone screen,  I reccomend playing on a tablet instead. Quick chat is easy to use. Normal chat can also be used if you make an account,  but its hard to type on a touch keyboard."

"This game used to be awesome. Before the quick chat update came everything was perfect. Now,  we have to ask our parents permission to do a lot of stuff. I also noticed that whenever Im an imposter,  I lagg alot. But besides all that,  the game is awesome"
"You should add a map called THE YOUTEOGUS And its basically a minecraft map with three different statues of youtubers dream, ldshadowlady and prestonplayz"
THANK YOU FOR FIXING THE CHAT PROBLEM ALSO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ADDING MORE NEW STUFF LIKE 15 PLAYERS
I really like this game but the chat sucks. I hate that you cant say things like there friends and teaming. Stuff like that its kind annoying to press those buttons and you have to find the right ones it just takes forever by the time u send it everyone has already voted

You have to go through so many steps just to chat and not even say exactly what you want to... I preferred the previous version please fix these problems or delete the new version.
Its a decent game when I played it awhile back. I decided to come back I made an account and whatever but when ever I try to press Find loby it wont let me go in. I can create a lobby but when I actually press confirm it doesnt do anything. Idk what to do.
This update is so stupid you have to sign in to get free chat and to change your name thats so stupid Ive seen worse than people curse in chat this update is horrible fix this damn game
This game was best before update half the time goes on finding statements

"I like this game but the chat is annoying and i wish it would just hashtag out swear words instead of the new chat feature. Apart from that good game,  very fun. I just hope they change the chat fearture"
I love the new update but i think they should change the NAME update because everyone loves to put their own name well but i think NAME update is also nice so downlode this super fun
this game is good but the new version is horible so I decided to give only 4 stars

"First of all you cant change your name and second of all we cant communicate properly with other players and sometimes it just disconnects you for no reason when you are in the middle of a game,  you have to fix all of these problems."

Also a GLITCH just broke THE GAME and everyone left my server because it was all BROKEN and infinite bodies were being reported (I think it was because someone reported when someone else called a meeting) And now I have to wait like 1 hour to GET THE SERVER FULL AGAIN. Please fix your utterly miserable game."
"So many bugs  And this never shows the correct maps you are searching for ,  it kicks you out of the lobby when you joined just ago ,  sometimes game continues after every imposter is voted out and so many more bugs ,  new update is not nice  Please change the game to the old version and I dont lik...Full ReviewSo many bugs  And this never shows the correct maps you are searching for ,  it kicks you out of the lobby when you joined just ago ,  sometimes game continues after every imposter is voted out and so many more bugs ,  new update is not nice  Please change the game to the old version and I dont like the new among us "

When it srtarts the players cant leave untilm the game ends i really would like that because when the game starts if they arent the impostor they imideately leave the game. Thats why i would like that kind of game. AMONG US IS THE BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED THANKS INNERSLOTH FOR RELASING THIS GAME. I HAVE BEEN PLAYING SINCE JUNE 2020 AND I HOPE THIS GAME IS GOING TO BE MORE ADVANCED. 
Really great game. The 15 player update is so fun and I cant wait to see good updates like this come out in the future. Reason Im giving it 4 stars is because sometimes my game wont let me load in and I have to uninstall and reinstall
I love the game just one thing pls remove chat commands I love this game tho
"Game was fun. However,  now they want you to make an account in order to free chat wich is just the normal chat the game had previously. Im not interested in making an account to play Among Us the normal way. Uninstalled."
When i was playing on a LG phone and in the airships cargo place it didnt work
good game but if u had quest like get imposter 5 times u win a a skin
"This whole sign in stuff is just bad... And not important at all,  well i know its importance but i dont think u need it in a game like this"
I put four but I like this game even when I play the airship map somtimes its hangy but when someone sabotages im not hangy but can u put free pets please and free new hats bye )
I used to love this game but now its trash bc of the chat now its kinda hard to say anything
"I love this game but the reason i gave it 4 stars was because theres some kind of glitch that happens sometimes,  ok first i was crewmate doing tasks in the map airship then someone finds a dead body but then it shows MANY people INCLUDING ME who are found as dead bodies but the thing is I havent die...Full ReviewI love this game but the reason i gave it 4 stars was because theres some kind of glitch that happens sometimes,  ok first i was crewmate doing tasks in the map airship then someone finds a dead body but then it shows MANY people INCLUDING ME who are found as dead bodies but the thing is I havent died yet AND THEN IT WONT STOP SO I HAVE TO LEAVE THE GAME,  If some of you people experienced this pls let me know or is it just me,  but i still love this game thank you."
I really like this game but wnen the new update com i hate it why Cuz i hate the you can not chat by your seld anymore so i get vote ouf every time and when i the imposter is fun killing but sfill cuz i been voted out cuz i can not rember what chat is what so plz fixed that i want to chat by my own...Full ReviewI really like this game but wnen the new update com i hate it why Cuz i hate the you can not chat by your seld anymore so i get vote ouf every time and when i the imposter is fun killing but sfill cuz i been voted out cuz i can not rember what chat is what so plz fixed that i want to chat by my own remove that atu chat even youtuber has to use voice chat no more normal chat and i hate it

"It would be really nice to actually get to play the game,  you give multiple updates and still I get kicked out or cant even join,  I try to play on my phone,  but it isnt allowing me,  please fix this and this game,  thank you."

"Wow just wow,  Yall Literally Ruined One Of The Best Game In The World Right Now. The Only Thing Ill Say Is Bring Back The 2019 and 2020 Version Back CAUSE THIS UPDATE IS REALLY NOT IT."
Wish you could type whatever you want.

In stead of typing your little accuse for not self reporting you get a button that sends you to a very very very veeeeeery complicated menu full of wordsthat sends you to more words which takes 50 000 hours still just to say you were with someone. This update is ultra mega super duper uper  i just hate it the map is good and cosmetics for your character but everything else is trash so 2 stars
It is really satisfying when u kill the crews and when ur crew and u die I like the quality btw the Airship map is out thank u innersloth
"There used to be the language of my country but in the new update it is no longer available. I cant play anymore with my countrymen and forced to play with foreigners speaking a different language. Even if I tell them to speak english,  they dont so meetings are meaningless."
only reason everyone hasnt voted 5 stars is cuz they play on the original iphones and cant run it lol. great game its awesome. no complaints. amazing. cosmetics are nice. simple yet unique features are genuintly what makes it so good. cant wait for innersloth to do more fun stuff with their game.
Ok ok its a little better but WHY Cant we type thats why I dont play anymore I loved when we could type I could make friends but now I cant do that because of the stupid talking system change IT BACK Or maybe make there be voice chat.
"Its too complicated to talk,  please put back the old chat"
Still a good game but the update is horrible I liked a lot better before the new update 1 you cant choose your own name unless you have a certain app 2 you have to wait a long time to see if you are crew or imposter and worst of all 3 YOU CANT CHOOSE WHAT TO SAY YOU HACE TO GO TO A CERTAIN BUTTO...Full ReviewStill a good game but the update is horrible I liked a lot better before the new update 1 you cant choose your own name unless you have a certain app 2 you have to wait a long time to see if you are crew or imposter and worst of all 3 YOU CANT CHOOSE WHAT TO SAY YOU HACE TO GO TO A CERTAIN BUTTON AND THEN CHOOSE SOMETHING THAT NO ONE WANTS THE KNOW
At first i deleted this app then i decided to download it back cause i felt like playing it nd the chats came bck up which is the reason i deleted i was so happy 5 STARS

Please guys its a request, look into this matter asap.I dont think some random internet people can do more things then the creators of this game."
This is a really fun game for kids from the age 7 to play. It learns you tactics and its fun to win as an imposter or crewmate. You can change your avatar color and you can dress your avatar...it is a fun game to play with friends and family. I would recommend you to download this)
Pls can you fix the texting cause I dont like it can you make it just like the last that you can text fast but I like this so I will give you some 5 stars thx for this game I like it very munch
This game is awesome but please remove quick chat type
Trusting someone and finding out imposters while doing tasks is indeed a hard puzzle to figure out

I dont know if you guys can do anything about this,  if not Ill just uninstall among us and forget about"
I loved this game so much but then suddenly when I tried playing it I couldnt join any game and I couldnt even do free play mode but among works perfectly fine on my brothers device. I tried restarting my device and uninstalling among us and installing it again by it still doesnt work (
"The game has a few bugs,  but Ive had a very fun experience playing,  4 maps,  and supposed to be another one made by the community on the way,  its got a lot of content and is really fun,  I would recommend this game to anyone."

I loved the game but Im just a child and i cant sing in and before i loved this game mr.creator pls tell me how to free this cuz Ill give 5 stars
"Its fun Most people are nice and the games in itself are just interesting I do wish I could create an account to talk but for android users,  a screen that say Error GoogleAuthNoToken pops up. I do hope that gets fixed in the Submerged update."
why did they remove Teping your Tape anymore why they remove alot of the good Coolors and why they made lag even Worts there not a single game i Hade that did not lag the game dead now its dead like fallguys no body play diss game anymore

"The new updates are horrible. I honestly liked the old version better. No one likes the chat rules,  or the name rules. Why cant we just customize our name to what we want it to be I used to love this game but now I dont as much. Please fix it."
"I used to like the game but the new animations and art have ruined everything,  they look terrible. If you added an option to have the old sprites and animations back I and many others would probably play the game again because they look 100 times better."
Its amazing and fun but hard to controll the thing so I give it 4 stars
i would always play the game but now im deleting it because of the update you cant type what you want to you cant chose your own name. i liked it before the update
"I was addicted to this game until you guys changed it. Now it just feels robotic,  slow and boring. It lags and some of the buttons are bugged. This is really sad cause I enjoyed this game..."

i love the game but i can even text to the other players so im so sorry but it is a 1 star for me
The game is soo good but the new comment section is not good it is hard to use we need the old comment section back
Lagging is so much AND the black screen o my god
"The game is super fun. The app has some glitches,  like not being able to move or chat and there being a full lobby hit it says 015. The devs have solved several important problems with playing,  mainly immature and annoying players. All and all worth even a purchase,  but its free."
Buggy and easily disconnected

You spent more time trying to get a game started than actually playing if it works at all. Nothing but disconnect from server messages.
"Pretty good game,  actually. Very challenging some rounds I would give this a 55,  but even if I update the app over and over again it wouldnt let me join any games because the app wasnt updated."
"Full of bugs,  used to be really fun now its almost as fun as watching paint dry. The quick chat feature is dumb,  as theres basically no good reason why its there. The chat feature pretty much made among us what it is,  now without it the game is as good as gone."

Also a serious game breaking bug on the airship map they wont fix where people will become stuck in place and unable to do tasks. Community can be quite toxic at times with imposters outing other imposters for no other reason than spite theyve been found out. Should be a report function for people after they leave a lobby as well such as a recently met player section
Realy good game as a imposter and all tasks nice game
Give us the old among. I like to update just not the chat wheel where we cant type

"Collapsing game,  shame it had to be this way."
i used to love this game but after the new update it became the worse game ever. you cant even chat normally with everyone. the game also contains a lot of bugs. i really hope the developer can make everything back to normal again.

It was a great game. Until the update that forced you to use quick chat. It also brought us a terrible accounts system that appears to have no purpose.
I like the game and stuff but when they got rid of the ability for the players to type their words and made a word wheel I started to play the game less so I would like it if they fixed that problem.
"This game is great but I have one problem. I cant type what I want,  so I have to use the one where you can pick what you put in the typing box. Please fix this problem it made me uninstall then reinstall 3,  4 times to try and fix this but doesnt work."
Good except for chat. You cant even write freely written things
"I like among us and have played it since it came out,  but it has gotten to be annoying. The new update was disappointing because the talking is terrible and the airship map is really annoying to navigate through"
You havent fixed the sigh in issue with android players
This game is awesome I just played along cost and help me play along us
Its amazing but my brother is screaming all the time and I cannot type whatever I want
"This was a good and fun game until the stupid useless updates of the airship and lobbys of 15 and the new models,  their are really garbage and especially it change your name every update. I do not recommend this game. P.S it was back in 2020 and 2019."

Just work on your security aspects to prevent hackers. I want the old fun back. I dont want to sign in for no reason. I want free chat and name changes as before. If new version doesnt has these Im gonna uninstall and never touch amongUS
"An amazing game But my one issue is that there are no other game modes you can choose to play and and I feel like they would be awsome as long as their good game modes,  like a detective mode or a real hide n seek mode where you can hide in lockers or under beds"

I cant type in chat pls fix it pls and in the settings i cant fix the size of the drag and the volume and the music pls thx
"I still like it but not as much, You can change your b day to a later year tine to type normally, and i just dont like the cussing and when i tried to create a game i think it said error and when it said download smthn version it took forever"
Its hard to log in with all new changes
"This game i love but i only gave it 4 stars because it doesnt work on my Tablet. It only works on my laptop but the controls on th laptop is ridiculous. when i play a map,  when i want to turn it does but doesnt go through the door. Other than that,  Great Game."
"Uhm,  at frist I really liked the game but,  since I got grounded because of my annoying sister I was off for a month,  And when I had time time to play it would not let me go into the thing where it says find game thats why I give it 3 stars."
Fun but it needs some things to make it better

I do not like the new update yeah I do like the airship but I do not like to chat it is now not speakable and you cant say the stuff that you really want to say and I cannot talk to myself I want to say hello
"Its the best game eveer,  the only thing is that there is no friends system and the new parental control system,  when i activate it i still cant chat freely and change my username Please fix this and add a friends system then this game is worth 5 stars"
"at first ,  it was good but when the new update came I dont able to write my the name I love ,  not able to write so please resolve the problem"
Very popular game there is no ads at all its a fun game
What thr hell is happening with Among us these days Havent been able to play one single game completely. Keep getting disconnected because of extremely busy servers. And I have tried playing at different times of the day. Whats the point even if I cant complete a single game
I love playing Among us. But their update in June of 2021 is bad. Well I like everything about it but WHY DID YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE ANIMATION Please keep everything else but change the animation back and I will rate the game 5 stars.
"Just bring back the past versions where glitches arent that many,  because seriously,  it ruins the game This game was supposed to be fun but after the quick chat update,  it became a mess. Please fix this."

Hate it when this happens"
thanks for responding to my review and thanks for fixing the game for mobile players.
the quick chat system is kinda annoying and not rly a quick chat
"Playing this game is a nice way to vent out your frustration by space blobs,  I love it. Its cute,  sometimes funny and the need for observation and detective skills is really cool. I love seeing others trip on words after they got found it. 5 stars."
Horrible log in. Now have to make an account that costs 30p when the payment is actually taken. At the moment the payment screen freezes. Kids are fed up with it now. Such a shame As a family we loved the game and now we cant access it.

"the chat is so stupid,  it takes forever to say what you want to"
"I cant even play 1 game and I get kicked our,  Im connected to Fibre and I tried all the servers but I get kicked out early in each game. Its very disappointing my phone meets all the requirements,  but the game is still trash. Fix ur damn game please"
Ruined with the new chat wheel. Pretty much completely ruinex
I cant play on my cellphone. This error keeps disconnecting me every time. And it is not my connection or server. The problem is in the game because plenty of people has the same problem. I wish you fix this.

I dont like either if we have to sign in or log into our account for free chat. I like the old version if there is a way the developers can change that Also love the animations
This game is very intresting I dont have any words that how to tell how much is good.
i like this game just its hard to talk cuse u cant really just tap it and then type but eather way i still love this game
This game is good but i cant play with free chat and change my name.Just fix that problem. Its so sad for the old players who r trying to play but they cant. Just help.us with that it will be better for everyone. I hope u guys will try to fix the problem as soon as possible.

Thank you for fixing the joining the game error because sit now and work for me but again I updated the app and now every time I go into a server and somebody starts it shows me a black screen doesnt let me play the game please fix this too I might add a five star if this is fixed two though.

I loved this but I HATE THE QUICK CHAT ITS NOT EVEN QUICK ITS LONGGGG
This app is so much fun to play with Family and Friends You just dont know who to trust from one game to the next

Bring back older version of chat or better if you fear of abuse divide the players who want to write anything can go on 1st server and who dont want any hate message can go to the 2nd server"

There is no gore or anything like that so you know if you wanna download this game. Its so fun to play and you can customize your jelly bean astronaut with hats and suits and all kinds of stuff. Some costumes and hats cost money and the pets do too but I dont mind.
Really good game i just love its new features when it was updated really nice thanks
Among us is fun for me because innersloth is adding a new map soon better than the airship. Its so fun i hope innersloth creats the new map soon
"Ruined in the new update Used to be fun,  now you cant type and have to choose from set responses. Google play sign in doesnt work so its just a game for 2 year olds now. Wont play again unless its improved"
I like the game and you can make mods but I do not like the map called airship I do like polus but not airship but I give it 5 stars
I like this Among us but..i cant sign in and i Dont like the update i like old Among us
Map is Good but the parental control system is not working for me and even when my guardian put yes in all permissions it is not working among us is getting worse day by day because of their system settings very bad
It was fun it is gist hard to sing in it but it it a good  game    
"This game is great indeed,  but the thing i dont like is that we cannot chat like... what we want to chat and if we want to change our name,  we cant. And one more thing is that please put the same percentage of imposter chance in every colour..."
"Its a fun game,  but its not fun enough to wanna play for like an 1 or 2,  its enjoyable but it just could us maybe a map update or something like that,  but other than that its a good game"

This game is NOT PERFECT but whenever I get in a game it just kicks me out very frustrating plus when a game gets full PUT IT OFF PUBLIC IT IS SO ANNOYING. But in the end this is a great game to play with family and friends .
This game nice and fun. And you add new task cleans the vent
The game used to be really good way back when but now I cant type in chat and now you need an account That is really unnecessary to the game. Its really annoying. Really Just let us pick our name. The game doesnt need your info. Jeez

"This game is great overall,  except for one thing the sign in. No matter how many times someone sends and resends the email,  it never shows up,  therefore they cant use free chat at all."
"I still play this game, is not that bad, it just..need to remove all the updates,  except for the new map, you cant type anything, you have to choose a word in the word place, the word just like a security system.And your name need to choose too."
It makes you email like some privacy info to aqually speak witch Im not able to speak now please fix this
I love among us but I gave it. Dogs because its very hard to login

Listen in sure you are getting a lot of complaints about how your game is being run now...and well LISTEN TO THEM
Its a good game just make sure to watch who your kid joins cause there is cursing
amazing update of airship buttttt why there is no free chat option why plese add it

My experience in this game is horrible I do not see the reason to sign in when the chat function to type freely shouldve stayed plz remove the sign in function as it is more annoying to do it to unlock free typing in the chat section do not make this mistake again
Good game but there is alot of hackers and the chat used to be were u could say wutever but ppl did bad stuff and the devs made it were u cant inless u like 13

No I hate it I have been waiting for that thing to load for over an hour and not even a pixle has loaded and when I did not and denied not even a round would load all I get is pitch black
The game was so much fun before they change it to optional chat. We cannot chatting in there which is so frustrating. Hard to defend myself when someone accused me. Hard to find the right chat. Please change back to normal. You can sensore the inappropriate words. Come on.

"the updates are horrible. among us is no longer fun...the graphics went down and the chat is impossible. if this game was returned to its original form i bet it would gain popularity again,  but for now this game is not it"
Its gotten way worse than it used to be if the creators want to save it they need to go back to how it was last year
I love this game there are impostors and crewmets and all friends and crewmets find impostor all one ok.but wait you are chat your friends now but.wait important point your mind you are all inpostor mix the game  last point 1 2 3 ok but. Bye guys
I loved this game until the updates came now its kinda bad I only play it when theres nothing else

I had my doubts after the first major update and gave 2 stars,  but the developers have fixed each issue really quickly and really well,  especially the account and quickfree chat system. Love the new animations and shading too. Great game once more"
It is very fun and enjoyable but the updates arenot consistent
If you go to free game then press 5 times imposter then you click to join and you will be the imposter 
"This game is really really fun,  but I ABSOLUTELY HATE that I cant freely text anymore,  ITS SOOOO ANNOYING Please take it off. It gets me passed and I dont play much anymore"
"Were happy that you added a new map,  hats,  and skin. But the chats makes it more hard to play. Also you cant change your name in game as long as you dont sign. Please remove the chat and sign in thingy. If that happened,  I might change my review. Thats all thank you."
It was Good before update but after update Some new features came that we cant do quick chat we have to click the buttons and there will be the options. Pls solve this problem 2) We cant Name the character If we will do that then it will ask guardian permission.
"This is a nice game,  but a few problems still remain. I liked it before the big update,  before it was what made amoung us amoung us. Now its just any game. also the chat doesnt have stack kill. and you cant type so please maby fix this other than that its a great game"
This stupid game makes me get a frickin guardian just to change my name and talk in chat THE way I WANT TO. UNBELIEVABLE.
I hate this new update because you cant make your own name and you cant make your own chat. 
OMG I can believe it I actually signed anncout to Google play games  now I connected to the game now I can chat free now I changed my name into (MOAZDIAA) thanks  but Im noob its okay thanks you developer for this update bye 
Now I dont mind about that stupid chat I only care about vent cleaning update.Please add the submerged map
Hey developers take everyones advice the new chat update sucks fix it
"Among us has really improved but now it looks a bit sloppy. But Im glad quick chat was fixed and it functions the way it used to,  and I really like the new colors. Thank you innersloth"

It is the best game I have ever seen. And the good point about this game is it is not bored how many times we play it. But some times the game updates but the updated versions are more beautiful .so I like this game so much.

Best game ever but one thing I dont like is that you barely get imposter you have to give us a better chance to get imposter
I do not understand why the typing feature was removed it makes no sense and also some of the things are not in the new typing feature for example you cant say what your objective is following a player is immediately found to be suspicious please fix this issue.
I HATE THIS NEW UPDATE EVERY TIME CHAT IT DOESNT WORK

Please do something about it,  its taking away the fun of the game,  because cheaters kill during meetings and some also cheats on telling other players who are the imposters are. We wanted a fair game,  because of this mods that other people use makes it unfair for everyone who are just trying to play normally with no modes or cheats."
Very annoying always get voted would like to speak to the manager of this game
So I love the game and all but Ive noticed the lack of the abilities to use Mods as you could in PC. Just think it would be a great feature. Maybe add in some exclusive mobile mods that can only work on mobile.
It is good but rhe problem is that the names and the chat is a problem but the game is good
"Couldnt change the age restrictions even though i am 13. It thought i was 10 and sent an email to my guardian. It didnt send the email,  I couldnt type in chat,  and i couldnt change my name. Great game,  not great if i cant even play."

And also the fact that u also have to dounload an app to sign in is stupid plz fix this
Before the update i love this game so much But then.. its boring now.. because it cant type correctly ..
i like the game its hard to but not that hard you should play this game you can play in the public or in the privet in this game you play as an astronot so who ever dream to be an astronot play this game
FeaturesThis new update is very good Like on previous update you were not able to say anything on the chat like every sentence able to use in the chat was in game related plus the animations are very dynamic in new edition. Disadvantages I sometimes get disconnected on servers plz fix this D
Clear and simple Quick Chat suuucks. Get rid of it.

Here is an old saying if its not broken dont fix it
This game is fun you can be the impostor are the crewmate you can do tasks and you need to find the impostor this game is lots of fun
It is okay but the new chat and random names ruined it
I dont know what fresh nonsense the added this for especially since I get kicked off the network all the time but now it says if you leave intentionally you have to wait 5 minutes. I left a room full of perverts to have to wait 5 minutes to play.
"I love the game but it wont let me chat by using my keyboard on my phone which I hate,  but thats it"
"I used to play and love Among us since late 2019. I know there are tons of problems that people are facing in this game but honestly,  I didnt face many of them. Maybe I did face them a few times but they werent that big of a deal. So as a satisfied fan,  5 stars from me."
Please make it so that you can change your username anytime without signing in like the good ol days
"Update Pros more challenging,  prevents bad words Cons became a bit boring,  Suggestions hope we can talk with mic or chat ,  f ever there r bad gamers we can just mute them like in mystery mansion. I like that game but cant keep it cause it cosumes a lot of data"
"First and last best and best game in my life. Its the unique ,  fantastic,  fabulous,  loving and enjoyable game . Hope this become world top game in future."
This Game Was Good Before This Update. Same Thing Its Bugged. I Cant Create A Account Due To This Which Means I Cant Play The Game. InnerSloth.... Make This Game Better Removing Bugs. If So Ill Give 5 Stars If I Am Satisfied. Edit The Game Was Fixed So As I Promised.. 5 stars.
Literally its a good game but I couldnt talk I saw somebody kill but I couldnt tell them the player
I loved the game before...this was my favourite game But the new version is just the worst..the old version was better than this..please try to bring back the older version

This game is my FEVORITE game but please dont add quick chat we cant talk with our friends properly please remove this type chat I want old chat setting
it sucks you need to put your credit card just to change your display name like this thing is annoying
Useless and futile updates The Distinct essence of the game is no longer embraced.
Its the best game. And no adds. I love this game so much and its so fun
"As much as I love the game,  the new 30 second ads are bullsh. Cant participate in the conversation after rounds and sometimes the room fills up before you get back in. I get this is free to play,  but do better with the adds and how theyre placed."
Plsss remove the update  bc Everytime I go in a server half the screen is black and we cant speek properly two each other

"I love it now that chats back this game i can confirm,  is good like egg."
The game is better and now you can report hackers and harrassment. Although sometimes there is a bug where the field of vision is glitched and all you can see is your feet. Fix this and I will rate 5
"The game is beautiful,  I advise everyone to download it,  it is fun and exciting"
This game bugged in so many ways its not even playable
Its a bad game with all the new fitures like u have to have a accout just to chat
I use to love this game but the new update made it so unfun 1)The free chat was better u could say anything u wanted. 2)The game is not as nice having to sign in with credit card. 3)We cant pick our usernames anymore.
"Well,  the game is broken for me. I cant join a game and cant create one. I get auto banned from every room immediately even one i try to create. Please fix so i can play I do love this game when it works."
Fun game but on my umx phone among us was very slow

"Hacking is a big problem for this game. Its hard to enjoy the game. Its unfortunate,  because its a really cool game. But you will get frustated by all of the hacking that takes place that you would eventually just stop trying to play."
Unplayable due to lack of arrow key movement
Im on mobile and I cant talk but only pc ppl can talk i dont like this game any more  PLS LET MOBILE TALK PLS. And then I will like the game again if this when it dose happen
"The chat is finally back Thats all I ever wanted on top of that there are new colors for players so thats nice and the game allows now,  up to 15 players to join Fun time"

When i log in everything when i join a game it shows me like black walls and i cant see nothing
"Turn chat off,  could be great. Turn off hacking,  could be epic. If you like lying and being lied to,  or fighting with strangers about who got caught in a lie,  this is the game for you. Otherwise save your time and sanity."
Cool and new task what a exited I like it beacuse I give five star arigatogozaimas )
Its good bit it can do glitches tho and the new chat is bad
I like this game but my the game change like. Quick chat only and u Can not Type your name.I remember the old among us. Where u can Type your Own name and u can say Everything on the chat. But i was give this a 5 star but game change and i dont Like it.
"I loved this game,  because of better human interaction,  but since the update it has changed a lot. It really sucks,  the previous version was way better than this. Not gonna lie I had been addicted to this game."

This game is cool and i give it 4 stars because you should add voice chat so then you will never get voted out
"I am kinda starting to like it but so far sooo.....good But i really wish you could put your own name and also chat like before,  bc this update is the worst its making things even worse so ummm you are still lucky for getting a four star rate But i am starting to get to like it"
"This game really gets my brain going. Its based on strategy and clues. Find out whos acting the most suspicious,  or whos doing too much of the obvious and get them outta there"
Bring back the old game. I cant even play a single round and I hate the sign in to an account its so annoying And I also get disconnected after a minute of joining a server and it keeps happening Change the whole game back to normal
"This game was so cool,  i used to play it for hours But after that,  it changed,  but they fixed it again i am so happy,  but now the game is not what it used to be,  i hope that people will start liking this game again,  lots of support and love from me innersloth"
"Okay,  I like this game. Its fun no doubt. But you need to work on the filters for how people create their lobby names because some can be very inappropriate and should be censored better. But otherwise its a good game."
I cant chat like I used to I wanted to play amoung us with my little sis but I typed in the EXACT code in uppercase and it said cant find that game I tried over and over again but it wont work so please fix this its just garbage now
"A really cartoony art style. This is a murder mystery type game,  with 4  15 players and 1 3 impostors. I really like this game,  its a lot of fun,  I think everybody should play this game."
Great game but the servers are TERRIBLE. I keep getting disconnected and the matchmaker is full. The same problem exists on PC.

I dont really chat in among us that much But i love it love the new voting screen Love the new map exited for the submerged map And thats really much it
The game itself is really good but its all ruined by the need to sign in and all of that and Im having problems signing in so the game was way more fun before the update where you needed to sign in to be able to freechat

I thought I havent played among us in a while. And immediately regretted hopping back on. The updates suck. Give us back old among us. The fun the game had originally is all gone due to this dumb update. Im never playing this again.

The air ship update when the update happend i left for a few days cuz i was busy and then a few days later i tried to join a Game and then it took 1 HOUR just for it to load. So can you guys fix please. 
"Its a great app, I understand that it has glitches and stuff..ButLets wait for them to fix it,  Although, I loved the new update...The joke I was cleaning the vent is now a real taskHope yall can fix these glitches"

I rate this app a 3 because i love the game but the namea people are putting are kinda annoying like i cant find a regular game the doesnt have a type of bad name in it
"Please,  remove quick chat to the old one. Lots of fun of this game comes from typing in the chat during discussion. I used to play this game for many hours but now I dont want cuz of that quick chat system."
"The game was totally amazing and fun to play until the new update came. Now we cannot chat according to our choice but have to choose an option from the limited given ones. This has led to poor discussion,  somewhat boring and we cannot easily communicate the update has maded it less user friendly"
I used to play it and it was so fun so i installed it again but it changed and became abut hard for me to play
beautiffull works great  and im ot a damn robot i actually ove this game ugh ANYWAYS

The game was fun..... But i dont think i could say that anymore i didnt expect the game the be this bad when i come back if you want people to play this game again u gotta add new roles and let us say what we want the game need to step its game up thats all i have to tell u guys
Among us is not good now because im staying at the black screen in a lot of time when the role is about to be shown
"The game has been updated and patched a lot since my last review. Good work. I was highly critical in the past and will continue to be,  but as of right now,  the game is probably in the best state its ever been in. Good on the devs"

Forced quick chat is the worst thing the devs couldve done.

I want to give this 5 stars but ( I love old version more . Its hard to message and weird names means like if someone dont wants to sign up then we cant name buy ourselves and lots of more issues. Its a request to you please bring back old version of this again .

The new updates themselves in the chat are terrible. Now there is no way to type what you want. If you want to say something that isnt available in the section where you can chose you cant say it. Also even after I updated it the app would say Im running an older version and wont let me play. I wont be playing or recommending until all of the bugs are fixed"
"It keeps saying among us cant authenticate you when i literally have an account. I cant even join any public servers Come on,  among us was supposed to be easy and youre making it so hard Ill change back my review once its fixed."
Its a good game the only reason I gave it 4 stars is the Freeplay the bots sit there and dont move it be cool if they moved and had the mind like a real player voted if they saw u kill just like a real player other than that keep up the good work
I do not like how we cant type what we want anymore because Im getting voted put for things I cant explain with the things they put.
"There is a bug in Airship wherever you want to choose any places you want to be spawn, You cant move until someone call the emergency meeting.And also sometimes the server will automatically kicked you from the game even if you have a strong internet."
"The games getting good,  I like how you can use more players and the new new layout Still annoyed about the chat and name but like I nerdloth replied theyre fixing it. So from 1 to 3 stars,  its getting better And I do like the new map too."
You cant type anymore and you cant pick your own username please fix the typing please quick chat is not that great
The new update sucks The name thing isnt the biggest problem but you took away the permission to chat I hate using the safe chat the only thing i like about this update is the colors and more players i wil give 5 stars when i am able to make my name and talk
This game CHANGED AGAIN At least is better now new task colors is AWESOME

The game used to be so fun until the creators ruined it with auto chat. It makes it so hard to give complex explanations and it gets really boring and its like a bunch of robots are talking to eachother.

Dont like it can you pls fix the chat I like the game but the chat
THE GAME USED TO BE GREAT BUT STARTED TO DIE THEY HAVE NOW UPDATED THE GAME BUT I BELIEVE IT IS FAR TOO LATE To bring players back to it and you can now not type in chat and you must click buttons for it to type but it is too late for this game and i think its time has ended
"It was an awesome game,  I really enjoyed the game and I gave it 55,  there were some issues in an update but now it is much better. Thanks for fixing the chat I am now rating it 55 again."

So was good,  then quickchat."

This game is unsafe. It allows hackers to roam and its asking for my personal information. Which no one should need to play a simple game. Why do you need my SSN You dont. Any game asking for my SSN should be shut down immediately.

Its fun and has awareness to it. But its fun
Remove the qucik chat option back to the normal chat

I hate when people just sit at the button and call meetings 247 I hate it but the the game is fun
This time the app started working. But i want old among us back which makes it worse for me to play and by the way i lag really much at the airship map. The map is to big that i cant even see anything tbh. I really like the game but im very addicted to it..

Instead it makes a freaking bad name and gives it to u as ur user name like VEXLUX. SERIOUSLY Like WHAT THE FK
"Would have loved to give it a 5 stars,  but,  they ruined the chat,  cant even say sus in the chat anymore,  and its really hard to use. Please fix the chat. Everything else is PERFECT."
First of all it is a good game I really enjoy it and the problem I am talking about are on the switch version. So my problem on the switch is that you have to put in your parents email to play online which is a way to have people to hack into your account and maybe get some money out of it.
I used to love playing this game so much the most recent update for some odd reason on my phone is that I cannot get into any of the public games or pretty much play at all. I keep pressing for public games or even open games and I cant even get to into any games at all to play
Old Chat was fun.Now there is no point in playing this game.
"Fun idea of game,  based on deductions,  but boring because of the IQ of the players. Limited chat. Its only fun if you play with friends or a premade group."
"guys you can just login and go to settings to change the chat. i know everyone is not willing or doesnt have an account to do that tho. it is what it is,  the game is good."

They should add mods because other people add mobs to their Among Us. So how come the creator of Among Us cant put on fun mods.
Amazing 1010 honestly lags a bit but good nonetheless

This version is the worst I cant even share any information through chat. You need to download a certain map for you have access on this game. They need emails etc.

Communicating with other crewmate used to be simple,  but now we are only allowed to choose from the provided phrases. I cant even save myself from being voted out by telling people that I have a visual task. Quick chat takes too long to use because I have to dig for a phrase that is close enough to what I want to say and if I dont know someones name,  I have to close out of the quickchat,  check their name,  and choose a phrase all over again."

After i updated the app,  the in game chat has been disabled and the option to change back to free chat has been restricted. I can only use quick chat. Its very disappointing and i wont be playing again unless free chat is back. The new map in this update is far outweighed by that change to the chat. Its very unfortunate. Im beginning to think this is all just an april fools day prank."

Having to click through the menu to type my message takes such a long time by the time I write my messages the conversation has moved on. It doesnt allow clear and specific information to be conveyed just basic statements that arent useful in narrowing down any details. Instead of taking away the ability to send messages add a filter if profanity is an issue.
"Good game but three star, because game is fun but suddenly why i must have email and guardian email, i need to log in and change my name, last thing that i hate, why it need to buy payment to get hat, your just like roblox game, about it, just put like money, gem or whatever, that was good, atleast that by me"

This sucks I cant type the key board Dosent work I have to chose from a skeleton it sucks
"I totally hate this new update coz its no free chat and we cant place name we want and when I want to sign in to play games, its say something went wrong. I REALLY HATE THIS GAME I hope the new update just like the old one with free chat and name we like"
"I know this is supposed to be casual,  but this game should really have a system for punishing players who ruin the game by quitting just because they didnt become impostors. Everytime the game starts half of the crew already are gone and it sucks."

Hey Thank you Inner sloth for fixing the bugs. Now I can play Among us perfectly. But there is a bug which needs to be fixed. Whenever I am an impostor on airship map after the first emergency meeting my player gets stuck till the end of the game.

Pretty fun. I mostly just play when I have nothing else to do though.
Omg it was fun until the dumb updates and ppl call meetings every 5 seconds

The game is truly amazing but there is one problem with it.. It doesnt have free chat like it did in the past. So am asking the owner to recheck this thing if it belongs to the inappropriate chat. You could ban the player instead.

Being unable to type what you want destroys discussion time,  you cant explain anything you see or lie properly when playing as imposter. The update has ruined the game,  they meant well but the changes were not thought through and ended up with poor implementation."

I partly understand the thinking behind it but for the most part I never encountered anything inappropriate and played with my own kids quite a few times. There must be other ways to block inappropriate language because this new idea has spoiled the essence of the game.

The inability to free chat is the biggest problem. Searching through all the options to find what I want to say takes way too much time. Issues with joystick not functioning. Have to switch to touch then back to joystick several times within one game. New map is cool but maybe a bit too big.
I used to love it to but the update is just soooooo sick but the new colors are good
"Tbh I liked the old Among Us better. No new map,  no account stuff,  no new dead body reported animation,  blah blah blah. Its not as fun for me now I guess. Its fine but I dont really like it now."

It was a good game before the update (besides the bug where no games are available to join but you cant host either because there are apparently too many games available). Now the updated chat function is really bad and makes the game virtually unplayable. There is also a glitch where after the first round many players characters are freezing,  causing half of the players to leave the game suddenly. Reporting bugs on Discord takes far too long as well."

The freedom with chat has been stripped away leaving players with preapproved sentences that are honestly very slow to use and much more vague as the ability to give an indepth explanation as to why you accuse someone is gone. Not to mention that it doesnt allow you to use the colours which is what most are accustomed to but you have to go back and check their names first.
"For the people having trouble with the quick chat thing ( 13 only ) Make and account and go to settings,  then press data and then if it says  quick chat  then click it and it should say  Free and Quick chat ."

I didnt want to install it,  but it just became so annoying along with the chat because you cant even get an actual sentence out. Please change it."
I actually like the new update but the things I dont like is that you can text whatever you want you have to use the thingy and it kinda weird and confusing pls let me text whatever I want pls sussy baka 
Please bring back the old comment section where it was easy to type comments...

This game is still a decent game but it has died down and I dont find it as fun anymore. I rlly feel like they should add new game modes 2 make the game fresh. But I rlly hope that happens soon.

You cant type what you want to type,  you have to use prewritten messages. It makes chatting slow and voting impostors off will almost always be a 5050. The new map is also laggy. The only way you can still play this game normally is to get 9 of your friends to get in a call and play or joining an among us server on discord."

But sadly in this new update I was lagging so much even more than i did before. Ones i couldnt even move and that never happens. When I move it lags so much,  and its annoying after a while.

And finally its still a good game but it would be better without the bugs."

Playing among us allowed us to be able to chat with all different types of people but now it feels like chains and barriers have been put on the gameplay and makes it less fun. if chats are a problem then put on censorship settings.
I vented to kill a guy and then guess what the kill button didnt work. Use to love it now I hate it. Fix it or else Im giving it a 1. There are literally over 2000 bugs.

You cant play it anymore with the absolutely stupid quickchat option (typing is a lot faster). It was better when you didnt need an account,  it was better without quick chat,  you guys just shot yourselves in the foot with this update and the game is going to die because of you and people are going to stop playing it. I will give the game 5 stars if you remove quick chat and accounts. Sorry."
Nice game and I would suggest to all to download the game if any one is seeing reviews and thinking download karu ya nahi so please download the game this is very amazing game. and at last bbbyyyyyyy

THIS IS SO GOOD I Would Like It Better If This Was Like Among Us Online. The Crewmates On The Game Do Not Move. They Do Online. But My Ipad Will Not Let Me Play Among Us Online Anymore. Can You Make The Game Just Like Among Us Online

Its a great game But theres a problem the quick chat it takes longer to chat and most people leave a game when they join. Overall I love it

Was really good until they started hacking again.. now you arent able to play a game without someone messing it up.. used to love this game. Still do.. I just dont play as often because of hackers..

Pls remove Quick chating system its becoming game boring
I love this game so much its my fav game but the thing is why I give 4 stars is because I hate the chat update please fix it you cant type what you want for example you want to give information of the person then u cant because you have to choose what you can write please update it better
"Been loving this game since I got it I usually play public lobbies,  which can be a nightmare,  but when you get a good lobby,  this game rocks"
It sucks it never lets me load and my internet is fine

If you havent updated DONT the airship is not worth it. Its large,  confusing,  and full of dead ends."

Super fun concept and I would play it everyday. The new update COMPLETELY ruined it. You literally cannot type anything and the stupid feature is useless. It was fun when the crewmates and imposters got to discuss who they think it is and what happened. Now we cant say anything. Its like voting blindly. The new map is also too big and not as good as expected. Still the game is now completely ruined and I wouldnt recommend it.

Also,  I cant even do basic things like create my own name. It sucks having to use a randomise button and feels very restricted. Only reason I gave 2 stars is bc the graphics are good."
"The new update is horrible,  its crashy,  I had troubles to sign in,  you cant type in the chats anymore and you cant even put in your own name. I loved amoung us before and am disappointed with how it is now"
This game used to be a lot of fun but now you literally cant do anything. You cant even type what you want to say you have to use the options on the game which literally makes it impossible. Also you cant even change your name anymore its just not fun anymore

This game is so addictive and fun I love how there is so many groups like for anime games and just so much more. The only thing I would change is the inactivity causing a game to close
"This game has honestly got worse and worse,  one of the most important ways to communicate has been erased. The chat. Just bring it back to when there was no airship. Then ill play."

The sound is distorted can you fix that
Quick chat is the worse I can type so fast if I was on free chat but I have use quick chat to talk but Im really slow when I do quick chat and I cant tell where I was in the game properly at all suspects is better and also I cant because I am a child and my mom wont give me permission

One thing that holds my review from that one last star is the purchasing of hats and skins and such. Wish it was easier to navigate and to understand what is actually a part of a bundle and whats just that one item. Thanks. Love this game.

Especially when youre being accused of being an imposter and you need to quickly defend yourself. Cant even defend myself or type anything properly. If swearing or bullying in the chat is a problem just make options for a map with chat feature and one without.

It takes forever to use new chat system,  and visual tasks are basically useless now because you cant tell anyone to come watch. In this pandemic this is basically my entire social connection because I dont have Facebook (by my own choice) now there is no social aspect. Chat limitations also make it very hard to figure out who the imposter is. No one can really share much information. bad update choices"
Use to be a great game but the new quick chat system is very hard to use..but instead of that change it into freely chat and if some people types any bad language ..change that to sensored chat automatically...

As for the freezingni think the dev made it that way so that each character can take turns to moce so that we know where each players went. As for fixes. I just really want the free chat to be back."

But with the new update you cant change your name. Or even say what you wanna say it feels like the game is controlling you more and its just not fun,  I might as well go play with robots. The game was magical and fun but with this new update it feels boring and plain."

Now Im also reading reviews that mention other bugs. So unimpressed I am yet to play the new map but Im quickly losing interest anyway because it seems Ill be waiting a while.

It became hard to play due to the lack of communication. The chat words that theyve suggested are also not too great and hard to play with . You cant state what youre trying to say without having to look for what is needed for at least 2 minutes. Hope they bring back the old version where you can chat with other people and not feel like youre talking to bots. Very disappointing

I hate the new update its driving me nuts... Plz have the new update so u can do proper chat and U can do whatever name u want.
Happy But can improve. With a new map  new tasks.
"The game was alright in the beginning but with chat real i just loose intrest in playing the game,  because sometimes you end up getting voted out while trying to look for the words you need in the chat real."
It has fun gameplay and high quality graphics but my only complaint is the sign in its really unnecessary and does not work for some people so and its kinda frustraiting using the auto chat and not being able to pick your own name the game worked fine before and id really like it to be removed

I couldnt type in my own response so I could only use the suggested response. But those ingame responses are actually limited so I couldnt really talk properly to other crewmembers.

Taking away free chat.. I get,  as I was finding the speech and player names disgusting and uncomfortable even with censored chat. Not kid friendly at all However,  at the same time its now complicated and makes it so difficult to discuss and deny which is the whole point of the game. The game takes ages to load,  cant use codes to join games and the characters freeze in the cafeteria after a meeting ended"

Its also rlly sucks that u cant make ur own name. The only reason I added 2 stars is because of the avatar and map. I used to be obsessed with this game months ago before the update. Its horrible now.

The reason I give it only 2 stars is because the new chat system is a big let down. I feel that there are other ways to filter out the inappropriate language (reporting,  suspending,  banning,  not being able to typesend inappropriate words). It honestly took a lot away from the game and I hope it gets fixed because Ill probably stop playing it as much bc its harder to communicate. Please fix that,  otherwise it was pretty fun."

They need a moderated chat or automatic kicking system for saying certain words or something anything other than this stupid quick chat. I have no space on my phone for the google play app thing you need for an account. I barely even have room for among us itself,  and I did try it but nothing works. Among us is ruined. Until change no play"

It causes misconceptions and misunderstandings when you cant fully describe situations or cant defend yourself besides saying blank is lying. I feel like people 12 and under are understandable but 13 and up know what theyre doing and how to play this game. The update makes the game unfair and unfun to play online.

Not sure if removing free chat was intentional but it sucks The preset quick chat phrases are never enough and even if there were more options it takes way too long to scroll through preset phrases when reporting a body or defending yourself as the imposter. Its sad to say,  but I think this update killed the game..."

Worst of all,  to me,  are the people who tell everyone to vote someone based on a random guess when this is supposed to be a game about evidence and deduction. Also a lot of glitches come and go."

If you could fix at least one of these things Ill change my rating to either a 4... or a 5. Thanks.

I made both local and online maps and both just simply freeze after an emergency meetings or meeting in general ( turn out it doesnt freeze you just need to change control type to make it work again).
