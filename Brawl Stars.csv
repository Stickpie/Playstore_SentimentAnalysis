Ive been playing for years  and I think its time to stop. Terrible how they dont take care of long time players.

It has good graphics and awesome characters.Lots of game modes and variety of stuff to play. I stopped playing 2019 because for 3 months I couldnt get any new brawler. I started playing about a month ago and I still havent gotten a new brawler. The chances of getting a new brawler is way too low and it starts to get boring when you dont have a new brawler to play as.

Solo queuing might be not so good (which I think is pretty inevitable in all online games and that we should not complain about it) but the game makes it so easy to find good friends and team that you can play with.

I love how they listened to concepts  ideas and complaints to improve the game  and they really deserve a pat on their back!! Glad to see Youtube creators and developers getting along with one another well . No games are perfect  but Brawl Stars is a perfect example of how games should be made and managed in order for them to become successful.

In app purchases are too expensive. The amount of gems brawlers cost are around 10 20  and up. After unlocking the inital trophy road brawlers and receiving a couple in brawl boxes  its been a while since ive gotten a new brawler. Some people have a budget. Also  spawning in boss fights should allow more immune time and should spawn players further away from the big boss. It doesnt allow enough time to get away. 
First off  amazing game. Truthfully I think it deserves 5 stars but my one nitpick is with the matchmaking system. If you play a match with 2 other randoms  leave the team  and go back to playing the same game mode  there is a reasonably large chance of teaming up again with at least 1 of the 2 rand...Full ReviewFirst off  amazing game.

Considering you would do this in the case that you dont necessarily want to play with the same team

The game is based on using a brawler

The only reason I didnt put 5 stars was because most of the time it says my connection is bad even though its not and thats really annoying. And other reason is the teaming like every single game with a rank 25 brawlers every one is teaming. Theres nothing else to say about brawl stars for me its the best mobile game out there.        
2p Okay  I am a little more happy then before. They are updating the game and the tryhard bots are mostly gone.

One main issue I have is that in 3 v 3 games the random players I get arent  let just say good. I am also not the greatest so maybe that has a point  but still. I always feel like that I get a bad team. Lets be honest  Brawl stars Is losing steam. I know this game can be amazing and it is sad to see that it is kinda flawed. Finally we have the overpriced skins. I hope it improves. 
So the game is balanced until you reach 100 trophies than you get Fed on for the rest of your matches unless you have a maxed brawler  so tired of fighting match after match vs power level 10s when Im using a power level 1 or 2 its massively unfair  you have to hit them about 6 to 7 times and ...Full ReviewSo the game is balanced until you reach 100 trophies than you get Fed on for the rest of your matches unless you have a maxed brawler  so tired of fighting match after match vs power level 10s when Im using a power level 1 or 2 its massively unfair  you have to hit them about 6 to 7 times and they hit you once and you die. Seems kinda like pay to win (No maxed brawler  lose)

Hardly ever do I get bored of it  there seems to always be something new to discover or achieve. I have nothing but good to say about this game and would recommend to anybody. Even though you can pay to upgrade your Brawlers and get a strategical from that  it doesnt break the game. If you are coming from MOBA games like LoL or Dota Im not sure if youll enjoy this  but I would still say give it a shot.

Players throw games without consequence. You match with the same random if youlose. The power level is always higher on one team. devs dont even know how to balance power levels for fair games. underdog compensation isnt enough  and the difference for that should also consider power level. great game  but if only matchmaking is better  then my experience would be 5 stars  but getting 100 trophies lost because of bad randoms is bad experience

Ive used Lou of power 5 to win a showdown match with brawlers that are power 10 9 8.. as for the skin purchase. The thing is just to play power league get to at least gold 1 and by the end of the season u get ur skin. The showdown teaming is a normal tactical move  if it always hits u then try joining them. The only problem is getting brawlers its difficult

Not pay to play nor pay to win like 90 of games these days. The first characters you unlock for free are just as powerful and useful as the rarest most expencive brawlers. The games balance is great and the gameplay is smooth and simple. The only downsides are small. One is that it can at times feel very grindy to finish quests  especially when you have to use brawlers you dislike (poco). Another is that the matchups are sometimes unfair  but its rare enough to overlook.

The game is never the same because you are pitted against opponents from all over the network with various degrees of skill. The developers do a great job of making me want to come back  day after day  with the gifts  upgrades  skins  bonuses  coins  points  brawlers  maps  and rewards.
Its a fun game to play with friends. The only thing that can make players entitled is the luck system. Some players are lucky  while others might get a new brawler once in a while. The Brawl Pass does bring a change but it also can do nothing to some players.

It has great animations and the characters are very well designed. One problem is that the wifi connection for this game is ubsurd. The game will freeze a little every match. This game you can see has a very P2W aspect where if you pay you get more shards for characters. If you pay you get the premium pass and the guarantee featured character. Overall a very fun game but maybe tone down the money involved and the P2W players getting better rewards and higher lvl units

Gems are rarely found in events and stuff and for that we HAVE to purchase the gems from real money to get exclusive items. I personally think that the skins in the star shop are a bit to expensive as the prices go till 10 000 and above and adding other items for star points would be just great.

But thats no fair for players that dont have gems or money to buy I know they just save up the gems but by that time they wont get their fav brawl in that specific brawl pass. But anyways this is fav game so thats why I gave a 4 star not three star . But I have played this game 3years so please make at least one balance change this month.

This is my favorite supercell game! The characters graphics  gameplay are all great. The new single player mode will hopefully keep those frustrating players from camping in solo showdown. I would really like to see some new maps or at least new color schemes and or themes.      
This is the best game i played ever player. it is not much hardcore  easy to understand. can play anytime and stop playing anytime. the reason uninstalled it a year ago was because  this game is addicting and i wanted to focus on studies. make sure to try it and dont unistall in 1st week atleast.

I really like this game. It is fun  you can play with friends and unlock very cool characters. But it would be a little more fun if you also could win gems along with trophies or at least earn gems somehow except for getting some gems by brawl passes. Over all love this game.

And the rewards are 13 times more than 169 gems. Honestly  I have to say that the brawl stars developers really cares about their players and they give free rewards every once in a while. Thank you brawl stars developers

And even if you are up against a maxed brawler i think if your experienced enough you can take em down. Only thing i wish is for in the future seasons is for brawlers who do something more than the others. Every brawler is different but I want the feeling of a brawler with something really cool and different.

Overall the game is bestest ever I seen though supercell must introduce a new rare or super rare brawler hence  the game is better than free fire. Must install and play it. This is my thinking. It is my most favourite game and I will also suggest that you also try it at least one time and I believe you will like it the most.
I was drawn to this because Super Cell usually creates new genres that everyone else rips off of. This game is fun and fast paced. Its got loot boxes but they feel like a good value. Now this game is biases toward pushing you to the 10 battle pass but its well worth it

Supercell are trying to work on the report button. Also the pass is 170 gems so f2ps can save up gems to buy the pass.bye zaid101      
Really a good game! Just like what i expected from the same people who made Clash of Clans. This game is entirely F2P (Free the play) the battle pass and everything unlike other games. The only issue is the matchmaking system because sometimes I get put into matches with Pros.        
Its a fun game with quick rounds and a large variety of characters. My only complaint is sometimes you get some bad teammates and I think you should get teammates and enemies who can adapt to each others play style (also you cant say what you want like actually typing) good game overall

This is supercells best game yet by far. It is incredibly easy to pick up and play  its addictive fun and action packed as well as having terrifying yet interesting lore behind the game. Supercell truly poured their heart and soul into this game.       
It is a nice game and the graphics are also good. There are so much nice game modes but the only problem is a bug when I move straight sometimes my joystick stuck in the direction I was moving. Please fix this bug or glitch this is so annoying BTW everything is best. )        
Nice little game that can be play casually  And while you can pay you would have to pay quite a bit before it gave you a definite advantage. And for those of you that dislike even what little pay to win exists remember that with out that money brawl stars doesnt exist  servers dont run for free.

One of the best games out there. But needs a better way to fix things. There was a misunderstanding for me and I went to supercell to try to get it fixed and they simply said they couldnt. Cause of this  I have no way of getting any brawlers or skins unless I grind like hell.       
This game is insanely fun  and the offers arw completwly balanced. The one thing I complain about is trophy loss and the amount you lose. At Rank 20 I already lost 6 trophies from one match. I know it makes the game fair  but thats my only complaint. Overall this game is golden

The powerleague is the most trash feature ever added as it is difficult to play and grind

I am playing it from 3 years but got only 30 brawlers

Pretty nice game. Game machanics   gameplay is 100  good  but the problem is with the joystick . I want to lock it at one place but is moving all the time it led me to loose many matches. Please add feature for fixing our joystick.

The amount of effort that supercell put into this game is unbelievable. They even made a storyline an Evil theme park! Definitely worth the download!

My other friends have so many good brawlers my one freind has 2 epics
PLEASE add a report button. I am tired of getting matches where my teammate gives up and sits in the spawn. It makes it almost impossible to win at that point making it a 2v3 and nothing happens to them they just go and do it again and again.        
You made a legendary game Love this And theme music is awesome. My first online game . The game is also best for f2p and those who want to spend some money. But the only problem is it lags sometimes even when you have wifi router. Still giving 5 stars        
Love the game  but it has some serious issues. Ive been playing for a long time and the entire time its had bad servers  slow matchmaking  balance issues  and it incentivizes you to play in a way that isnt fun. Would love to rate it higher  but the problems have been around too long.

Great game. very friendly community and makers. The skins are nice and every update it packed full of good stuff. The game is big though and takes uo lots of space and crashes every now and then if it doesnt have enough space. Worth playing

Or  at a bigger rank  there is just teaming. I worked so hard to get leon to rank 25 just because the infect teaming i get when I play. And there are a lot of teamers in solo modes
Its one of the best games i ever played (Im not joking) only reason I didnt give five stars is because of the invite friend and when I want send a friend request it requires me to put in a link or something like that but why cant we just put in the name of the person.        
Ugh..i love everything about the game and buy the monthly pass  but you guys really need to add a report option. Or at least make it to where we loose less trophies when other players go out of their way to make the team loose.

This game has one bug I noticed  that is if u have 10 gems in Gem Grab with Edgar and last second you jump  the game continues with Edgar with 10 gems still. This almost caused me to lose. After that bug fix  easy 5 stars. But for now  4 stars.

The game is fun and exciting. The feeling of getting a new brawler is thrilling but my problem is the fact that I cannot open the game after this current update. I can play the game for hours but now the playes are even tougher which is a good thing

And because of this I just have to guess where the enemy brawlers when they are at the edge of the view and if they get close to the enemies  they just die easily by the enemies. So I just want their field of view as much as their range are.     
This game has many options of character  but most of them are hard to unlock. Most of the account cant get any legendary only if you use money. Overall its a good game. No ad especially.

Saying the servers of this game are potato servers is a huge compliment. Every match is a gamble  youre either allowed to play as usual or stuck to the floor while the other players use you for target practice. Update Your game is broken. Doesnt work well with wifi.

This game is good. But has lot of issues  mainly the network bug  even though you have a good internet  this game will stuck in between games  then you have to uninstall and reinstall. Also in showdown team up will ruine your game. Need to add report button for team ups in showdown.    
Every one to three games or so the game gets stuck on the prematch loading screen. Its as annoying as it gets and the game is almost unplayable now. Please fix the bugs in your next update Edit After the update the problem is still the same

The 10k and above trophy league seems to be a bit too time consuming and feels less rewarding in my opinion.

There is also a problem with bad teammates and unfair matchmaking. The opponent may have a fully maxed team while my team is not(not in power league). When in high matchmaking  I will encounter teammates that only have 10kplus trophies while the enemy has 30kplus.      
This is a super good  excellent and addictive I play it EVERY day no matter what  but something you could add that would make me VEEEEERY HAPPY is an option to buy gems with coins it will make the action of getting gems easier but its just a suggestion do your best for the next update

I also think there should be a game mode where there are no power levels which will strongly assist the competitive aspect of the game.      
Its a really fun game and I love that the developers always add new and interesting updates with super cool brawlers overall it has evolved so much over the years and I simply love this game even though i dont usually get new brawlers it still is amazing.

THESE players are around 1025k... And there are no problems in that range  after that you will truly hate the game. The game was great but since last year it has stopped fixing obvious problems like teaming in solosduos  very unfair matchmaking  If your 30k you have a chance to get paired with a 15k. Sounds insane right? very big skill cap difference.The Majority is less than 10k thats why most 5 star.    
This game is easy to get the hang of  with many characters to unlock  my only complaint is that it is very annoying to try and get characters cause you need quests to get quest tokens so you can get boxes for the chance of a new character      
Game is amazing! I do hope you can consider adding controller support. I dont think it would give more advantage but it would be comfortable and fun to use physical buttons. Anyway  keep it up!

Good game overall .... It is fun to play   I would have given it 5 stars if we would get brawlers when opening crates .... Literally it has been about 4 months and I have opened about a 50  100 crates ... I dont and get a brawler       
This game is so good as it has a wide variety of brawlers from trophy road to chromatic and all the new seasons. If you dont already have this game I suggest you get it  it will be worth it 1010.

(Thankfully  even though it resets the players to the spawnpoints it doesnt change the score.) 2 I have started seeing frame drops occasionally.  
It is a fun games but as of recent it has been extremely laggy for no reason. I have deleted it and reinstalled it twice. Itbis not my wifi sonit us a servernissue I assume. Please try to get it fixed  i have put money into this game.       
We can add freinds  open boxes  collect brawlers  make groups  fight online people  make your own maps  and collect coins to upgrade brawlers  Starpoints to buy stuff in shop  and also u can collect trophies to win stuff by them and tokens and u can age ranks on brawlers
This game is one of the most entertaining game in battle royale games after fortnite. I like the brawlers too much I just love them. Their powerups are too good. The game theme parks   mechanics are too good . I liked this game too much

I p ayed this game since beta to global launched and i always enjoy playing the games i like that they are custom game modes and brawler have different ability super   gadget and star power. As the result this game is the best game i played. I play this game every day.      
Its use too much internet data. Keep lagging and network lost signal. Another online game i played no problem. Please make it use less internet data and playable on bad internet connection. I really love this game.

Ive been playing since 2019  i love the game. Its really good for casual or competitive players. I love the lore  teaming in showdown is where this game really sucks but other than that i recommend it.

Awsome game really is.The only thing is that I have awful luck with getting brawlers.My mythic chances have been 0.2696 for 2 months  while my legendary chances are 0.1348  and it has stayed 0.1348 for 3 months.The last I got a brawler was griff  which was I thin 12 months ago.

Idk why supercell is not improving that trash but focusing on other things. My teammate chose a lvl 1 edgar and all my enemies are maxed. Either add a way to report your TEAMATES so if a person gets a certain amount of report they get suspended from power league for some time  or dont allow people to pick brawlers less the lvl 6. Also reduce the amount of points that you lose when your TEAMATES go afk. If they go afk the bot just throws the match. Plz supercell

Its a decent game  the gameplay is good however many brawlers are very overpowered therefore its unfair  also I have been playing this game for about 2 years and I still have not obtained a legendaryI dont recommend spending money on the game

You wont have enough coins to upgrade your character and if youre a higher rank with that character then it will match you with similar ranked people even if theyre 1 2 3 or even more power levels above you. Id think it would be a simple fix by matching people based on power level and rank or just power level so there are no unfair advantages. But until then just know this game is begging for you to buy their packages        
If I had this game since 2017 the best ever never gets boring defiantly get it the best game ever plus its not just good guns or bad guns its different abilities that can be good and bad against any brawler(what the characters are called in game) I like it so much evern as a free to play player.        
The matchmaking is probably the worst I have ever seen. Implement a ranking system that isnt based on time played and maybe this game can live longer than the few more months people will be interested in a pay to win garbage fest. This is really disappointing.

This game is not even fun anymore. Playing high levels trophies is just dumb no fun and people not even the same level wonder why this game still have so many players.        
Game was so fun and challenging overall  especially with these interesting and unique features such as 1. rubbish and inbalance ranking system 2. couldnt report on trolling players 3. a cute red wifi signal will appear on the screen even you have a good connection 4. and many more.       
This is very good game and its concepts are also super but after the new update my game is crash automatically and its says to relogin and its same thing repeated very time  when I open my game and lagging issue while my data speed is very good. Hope supercell will fixed it  but very good game.      
Love the game  but today it somehow keeps on kicking me out! It says connection lost  try again  sometimes even in the middle of games! Quite unpleasant  hope it can be fixed    
What frustrates me is how the connection is poor. I have a stable internet but this game oftens say weak internet connection. I still remember having this exact same problem years ago when i first played it.

This game started fun then new OP heroes come in and numerous games during the events go AFK costing you to have to play short handed and lose a life. The worst is having players on your team who just basically go in the corner or walk into the gas yet you get penalized for losing and have no way to down vote them or something. Also why is the bandwidth so finicky to play it needs more than cod mobile or even pubg.

Best game ever!!! Keep up the good work. Also in brawl ball my  favourite game mode  if someone has the ball in overtime or before overtime if the clock before overtime hits 0 if someone has the ball then it shouldnt go in overtime      
I am playing this game since the time of release. Just 1 problem.Too many brawlers and many are unbalanced. Some are too op and others are too bad. Please fix this Supercell. And please give daily rewards if u complete a challange. Like free big box or 10 gems for a challange        
This is the most GREATEST mobile made for so long in my opinion. I have spent no money at all and completely ftp and I have 3 power 10 brawlers and the are all rank 29. I am slightly addicted too. Anyway thank you SO MUCH for making my childhood great!!        
It was too pay too win. Even with skill if you had low power level youd be in a unfait advantage since youre paired with the same skill but they have brawlers that have all the gadgets and star power. Made my delete the game many times. I quit

I really like this game its very nice but one thing is the luck system  it makes no sense because i have opened over 20 mega boxes and i havent got a brawler but on one of your chllege events i got a brawler. Please fix it because it does not make sense

It so so so frustrating As soon as i reach 700 trophies with any individual brawlers i find 45 other players starts teaming up  and when u request team up with them   they all together attack me   this is frustrating. I just want to ask supercell whether you are implementing bots to slowdown progess. If not then do something about it!!! Suspend them from solo showdowns for sometimes jut like power league  
This game is amazing! Its so cute  east to understand  and very interactive. You can even earn enough gems for a brawl pass over 2 seasons (4 months). I love it!      
This is a very very good game but it get hang in between the match so please please repair this hang and I have some ideas for skins like captain America rosa   thor Carl  iron man belle and more so please make these type of skins to make the game more popular.

The new updates are fantastic and we should all take the time to appreciate the dev teams hardwork. I would 100 percent recommend this game but the only bad thing is that a lot of the time  its pay to win. Other than that its great.

Smh!         
After the update the game runs slow and spikes. Its very annoying  especially when playing showdown. Everything else was great till now. If not fixed I will not be able to enjoy playing and quit        
This was a really fun game until everyone started to pretend to go afk  leave matches  and laugh at others for not being good. Now its a very toxic community full of players that will do anything to win.      
I am stuck on downloading content. I had this problem before also but i cleared my cache then it worked now again i am having the same problem. I know they fixed it so why i am having the same problem? The game is very good and i wanna play it. Plz fix that. Help

This game is completely f2p but its a little too f2p I played it for more then 2 years and I got every single brawler (except the newest brawler ash but I will get it after tier 30) its really fun and its also my favorite game.

It seems to be good but it is not because it is super cool. I loved the game I love you supercell release more games like this guys you guys can do this yaaa..... And the new club features are dope!! Keep going supercell...!

I have been playing this game since the launch . But after the seasons came I havent received a single brawler since 2 seasons. This game has become pay to win now. Graphics and gameplay is good but pls give brawlers.        
I really liked the game. It didnt forced you to buy any stuff but you could. Has difrent game modes. And lets me play on difrent devices with the supercell Id. To sum it up it was a good game )        
I really love this game  though it is really hard to get new brawlers  I have good connection and it is rare to say I dont have internet. Though a lot of people dont have good internet.m      
this is the best game of supercell even the best game in playstore....but you should make some occasional skins as rewards from any challenge and not only by buying it because there are many kids playing this game who cannot buy skins.       
It is a fun game but the thing what I dont like about this game is the maps. You dont have many options to choose from but other than that its afun game with characters who have different abbiletys.       
Connection problem is really really bad . My connection is excellent . I play YouTube  its super good . I open the game still good . When i reach to the battle   its too bad . It happens 3 out of 5 games. This game make me angry.      
Awesome game lot of brawlers but why I gave it a four stars because there should be more trophy road brawls like there is only 11 yeah yeah they are hard to get after getting all the brawlers and maxing them out what about boxes I know there will be more brawlers coming and new skins it is gonna tak...Full ReviewAwesome game lot of brawlers but why I gave it a four stars because there should be more trophy road brawls like there is only 11 yeah yeah they are hard to get after getting all the brawlers and maxing them out what about boxes I know there will be more brawlers coming and new skins it is gonna take like two months or something but still man I love this game so entertaining.        
Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. The graphics and animation is the best i have ever seen. The game is never boring. I love this game but sometimes it starts to disconnect while I am playing. Except this there are no issues!

Match making is really difficult  and the controls need to be adjusted  especially the movement control button. It s a cool game. The design and graphics are awesome. Big fan of your work  supercell    
This game is very awesome. But I have a complain whenever I start the game its says Connecting to the server and then downloding contents and after that it starts whenever I open the game. How to fix it ?        
I just love this game playing from 2 years it has had many changes which make us interested in the game.

I dont have any issue with matchmaking because it has fixed now(although 1000 trophy brawler takes more time for matchmaking but that is way necessary as there are not all players with rank 30). I wish I could give more stars rating. I never get bored and skins they make are so awesome I wish supercell also makes an option to make skins like map maker so everyone could make skins they wish.        
Its fun in all when I played in 2020 and grinded but now they have a brawl pass and I dont enjoy the brawl pass since now the whole game is based on doing challenges to get tokens for prizes in brawl pass I miss the old days when you get enough tokens to get brawl boxes  big boxes and maega boxes ...Full ReviewIts fun in all when I played in 2020 and grinded but now they have a brawl pass and I dont enjoy the brawl pass since now the whole game is based on doing challenges to get tokens for prizes in brawl pass I miss the old days when you get enough tokens to get brawl boxes  big boxes and maega boxes just from playing

I love this game but I wish I was a put stuff in mail not like skins like you did with the login but theres a catch you have to put in the same amount of money that it would to give your teammates in your club        
Its a nice game. But Ive played so much as a free to play that its sometimes gets boring. Like my brawlers are low power lvl but high rank like 1720. But as a chill game to play time to time is pretty good.        
I played this game for years  and its non stop fun! The brawl pass is worth over 100 dollars  but its for 15! The updates are awesome  and the community is great too! Please download this and have fun!     
THANK u so much supercell soo much for those balance changes especially showdown for people can go and enjoy showdown like it used to be. Thank you soo much and I love the game if u r not playing the game... what are u doing  u r missing out. Thanks so much sulercell for listening to us        
This game is amazing. The devs hears to community and solves the problem. The game is f2p too however p2w players can also progress fast so its balanced. There are a lot of modes to play so it never gets boring. I would definitely recommend downloading this game.        
This Game Was Very Fun and i was addicted. I play more now again so thats why i give it a 5 stars. Another thing that makes this a 5 stars for me is because i enjoy the game. I opened many boxes for many months without getting a brawler so i would like increased brawler chance. Thanks for reading        
Slowly loosing its luster. Its definitely becoming a paytowin game. I get paired with high level brawlers who are horrible players   which says to me that they didnt earn their rank rather paid for it. Also  connection issues are terrible on WiFi and without.       
Well  good game but I have some negativity 1.When I have opened data(mobile) it is not working. 2.Even if I have internet  it is lagging. 3.They make it more and more difficult.

Worst game with worst control... Not to mention.. u want to excel or enjoy gaming...start investing money... Not to mention its worst matchmaking decision.... What can we expect from supercell.... Same with every other games they have made.....

One of the best games Ive played. Everything is free including the gems. This is not possible for other games. Wish future updates will be more smoother. I highly recommend playing this game.        
Great game play! With different game modes to keep you entertained. But one thing  I am a 10k player and my friend is 4k and he has more legendaries and mythic than me  this really should be fixed. I think the higher the trophy the higher chance to get a new brawler.      
Great game only game that i have played for a long time without getting over it.....i have been playing for years. Will offer up five star when connection issues are fixed two many times have I lost signal and it comes back as we lose....only game that does this        
Very good game. I would recommend playing this game. Its a bit grindy though  and very slow if you are free to play. The wifi problem is pretty annoying too  and of course randoms are worst. But still a pretty good game      
As always  good game with potential but the players can ruin your experience by simply being afk  giving you a free lose  and theres nothing you can do about it.

Pretty fun game. lots of gamemodes to play. But sometimes this game is so insanely laggy for me.... When this happens  I go to check my internet. it says its fine. My other games works fine but this game gets soooo laggy sometimes. Otherwise I reccomend you this game.       
I cant play the game smoothly. I thinks there is a problem with network. I can surf the social media with high speed internet but then when it came to the game  the connection became sluggish and it often buffers while i am playing a match. Help me!       
I have been playing this game for years now. It never runs out of content and has keep me entertained for years. Updates happen quite frequently  adding new content and Supercell listens to the communitys suggestions and requests.       
This game is a total success . The good thing that it has no ads and the graphics are awesome . But you need too much time to unlock a brawler. And you need too many tokens to unlock a box too but it is pretty good        
Hiding and running away from battles as you shoot is the primary skill used to win. Add the inbuilt lag to cover the poor quality servers (nearly unplayable with wifi connections) and its a good looking game with bad mechanics designed to extract money.        
Game is fun but matchmaking system needs some improvement because of noob players. But game is great and becomes greater with every update. I suggest to give this game a try  you wont be disappointed cause is great and skill based game .

Game is a fun pvp twin stick shooter. Easy to jump into. Games are short. Rewards can be earned without spending cash. Season passes can be purchased for good value reward track.

Man Ive been playing this game for like 3 years and still my favorite game  even tho its hard to unlock other brawlers once your missing 4. But this game is a tun of fun. You should definitely try this app       
This game is amazing even though I like old brawl stars more. I saw a few people saying that this game is p2w which is bs. This is one the best f2p games all u gotta do is manage your gems and save up for brawl pass.        
This game is epic .... They have many events in which u can play and win brawlers as well as a lot of tropies .... They have daily rewards and tasks which makes it even more intresting I would definatly reccomend it WORTH A TRY !!!!

I Love this game so much! Its really a very cool game. The gamemode change everyday with different map and also a task to complete so you can unlock boxes on brawl pass! A lot of character with different super and attack. I recommend you to play this game!        
This game is amazing check it out!! There is lots of cool brawler and fun maps to explore! There is all kinds of graphics and cool details!Please download brawl stars and have a good time with me!!!        
Really fun game with a lot of stuff to do. I have been playing this for over two years and its never gotten boring. Supercell is amazing at making games and this one is the best of all of them!        
It is the best game in the world and it has made me and my friend laugh so so much ) I would rate this a 1010 for any ages. The violence is not actually that violent such as other games.        
Its been a wonderful experience but I have had problems these past days that it does not let play the game or enter and check if I have gotin something new and they stole 300 gems away from me so please fix what ever problem is going on        
This game is massively my favorite MMO game its my 1st favorite game because not only the graphics is good but the skins the effects the skills the passive attacks and so many others its a great MMOMOBA game because its just like an RPG but with MMO graphics on it and its 3d as well     
Quick  fun  addicting. I love how you can always upgrade your characters  by playing more  you can always get better with the upgrade system

It becomes a p2w game. The matchmaking is always unfair. Its annoying that people team up in solo and attack you. Playing with randoms will only make you lose. Power league unfair. Every month the  unbalance change  just ruins everything. The games WiFi is weird. When you have full WiFi bar  it appears a red WiFi signal and disconnect for you and make you lose. Starting the game now is too late. Dont play is game.plz     
Good game.Have been playing since release.but new power league system has made my experience worst.if there is a call during a power league match they suspend you for leaving the match for like 30 minutes.even we did nt leave.and they also reduce our rank for such situations.don t like this      
All is good but the network problem is always lagging and its too difficult to control   my trophies had decrease so much because of the lagging even I have good internet connection .The server is too slow so please try to fix it as fast as you can. I would be grateful towards you.       
This is epic game. Idk why people keep complaining about the lag issues. Gameplay is fun. It is easy to play and understanding the mechanics. I highly recommend this game for you if you are thinking to download it.        
I love this game and would give it a 5 if it didnt make me have to restart my game. I used to have 16 000 trophies and now I have 4 000 on a new account. But the game is still the best supercell game out there      
Why dont people play this more  this is a rpg battle Royale but not with usual guns  no you have unusual characters  like a bare girl called Nita  this game is more free to play game but if you spend money it will be worth your while  I have been playing for like 1 and 5 months and love it   
Power league(which is for max level toxic tryhards)  tournaments  and events put people with real life friends at a huge advantage. Honestly  the majority have to feel like theyre missing out on so much they cant get. Everything else is usually tolerable  sometimes good.    
Brawl stars is definitely the best supercell game Ive played. You can progress far even without spending money  Ive already gotten 24 brawlers even though I got the game a couple months ago. The game has good progression to. Over all a great game       
Awesome mobile game. A whole new take on the pvp multiplayer concept. Have played it casually for around 2 and a half years and I dont plan on stopping.

Played for a long time  leveled up almost all champs to max. The game is really good and updated regularly. But there is some concern about adding op pay to win champs and not balancing old ones. Plus whoever designed edgar should be fired  that champ ruined so many modes.

Lost interest in it really quickly  but when I was interested in it  it was really fun because I would get rewards every 100 trophies  now I get something every 500 trophies.     
It is a good game  really fun! Though it is kind of pay to win because you can buy stuff to improve your brawlers and get new ones. Still it has a big variety of game modes and free rewards. Good game!       
Ive been playing since day one. I love this game thus far dont get me wrong  but... Unfortinitly as in any battle royale game theres teaming and throwing. One thing i really wish to have them fix is the report butten. Other than that the game is great.

Please improve the chat notification  it is hard to notice when someone sends a message. And please return the teammate statusactivity bubble. It is hard to predict if your teammate is on hisher phone doing something in the lobby.

Since the game used to be good its a 2 star.        
I like it but I get too much connection issueslag spikes. Matching system is unfair  you get teamed up with people who has too few or too many trophies. Some players would afk the whole match. Teaming is annoying. Overall a fun and frustrating game Lol.

Long queues  sometime even and hour or couple of hours you have to wait for people to join. Suggestion.. try adding ai bots do that we can atleast play with bots... One hour to play a match not acceptable..

Its a good game. New characters. Really good game. You will have fun playing this. Brawl pass helps you progress in the game a lot more than before. Now the game is insane and worth downloading.        
I play this game since it existed wow i cant believe how much it upgraded the look  also the new brawlers are fantastic theyre cool and very happy playing this game. Im also good with the game so it deserves 55 because its really cool the game to play while listening to music xd       
I love this game because I always play it every day with my friend you play vs people and you can make your own map! ) If you dont like this game you dont like supersell games theres a alot of brawlers to colect        
I really like this game  it is fun and exiciting  the only thing I do not agree is that is too much expensive  maybe it can change a litte bit!     
Its a fun game if you have 5G or Wifi. The random lag while painstakingly trying to move around  teammates going afk mid match  idle for a few seconds and get disconnected. this game a hit or miss      
Frequent updates that add great new features coupled with fair and balanced gameplay makes this the top mobile game by far. No ads. No limit on play. NOT pay to win. Can unlock every single brawler given enough time  cosmetics cost real money.       
Fun game but lack of support for controllers is disappointing. Games like this are too uncomfortable to play using touch screens for longer than a couple of games.        
If you want to play this game with more than a few brawlers  be prepared to shell out insane amounts of cash. Severely disappointed in the rng of getting brawlers. You are heavily pay gated in this game. Honestly would not recommend.       
Look i love this game but the connection to any internet is horrible you will never get a game without lagging. This causes any person to lose a lot of trophies especially the high rank ones the. Still love the game tho just a bad connection.

Trash Match making based on trophies rather than power is madness. Power 1 with under 100 trophies matches are flooded with tons of power 910 players. Skills can only compensate power difference in maps with lots covers  in open maps  higher power really just destroyed the game. Some brawlers are way too underpowered. This MM has been ruining gaming experience. Extremely unfriendly for new players. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED NOT TO TRY THIS GAME OUT!    
Too bad game. You cannot play it well after reached higher level . It always shows network issue unless you have full network. I have not ever played any dirty game like that         
Great game but just want to suggest to decrease the price of power league skins from 25000 star points. Please  because less than 1 of all players have it. And thanks Supercell for providing us nice content and make our childhood amazing.       
So after the latest update  connection issues are there. I am lagging a lot which didnt use to happen before the update. So it will be greatly appreciated if the devs fix this issue as soon as possible.       
Im in love with another super cell game(try clash royale) and its my favorite  only problem I think Carl (the miner) should either be a bit invincible while spinning(his super) or shortly invincible after his super        
Game is little good but The problem is That Box When I open box all i get is brawler points but its been 4 months since I got last new brawler and till then I didnt get a single brawler I have like 25 brawler but still I didnt get any brawler cause its luck system isnt working.        
This game is noice. Probably in my top 10 favorite games. I like the new game they made beat stars but like a few people said they would like to see a story mode. That would be amazing but idk if that would look good on a 3rd person shooter        
The game is fun until u hit 750 in a single brawler its not even fun anymore i ve hit 30k cups and its getting really hard. Power leauge is just pain not even good people pick low lev brawlers  Play and leave. Please the game is getting bad and will die soon

Dont even start on the Boxes (brawlbigmega) its a scam ... Theyll lure you towards buying brawl pass! The game was better in the beginning as it grew they just monetized it more !!        
One of the best mobile games I have ever played. Seriously. No bugs  smooth animations this is one of those games that could rival Splatoon or Fortnite! I love playing it and I love the cartoony fun.       
It is a very awesome game I love to play it in my free time but it could be more awesome if there was a map called TEAM DEATHMATCH in which the first TEAM gets 20 or 30 kills wins I would really love it.

This game is good all round  if i can say the least. I think im especially gonna love the new mode thats coming to the game  showdown has the capability to give A LOT of trophies if you just play the game right      
I played this game for years and its still really good but surge speed is so slow like 8 bit plus in my opinion even with surge super he is still slow. I think surge would be better if you gave him a bit more speed.        
Great game. Ok there is a problem. I cant login from my device  even when U cleared my cache. My device is Xperia XZ premium. So can you look into it because everything else is working. Ok It worked now but I would like if you looked into the matter.       
Very entertaining. I would recommend if you like these types of games. Edit I cant even login! It says that its connecting to servers for like 2 minutes but then it just quits and it wont let me in. Plz fix        
I like your game. It has very good graphics and I love that you can make new friends. This WOULD be a 55 but theres something you should do.

It has very good graphics and I love that you can make new friends. This WOULD be a 55 but theres something you should do. First of all you should add back brawldays and make some of the characters free like last time when you put Edgar for free. Also  the gems are just WAY to expensive and I never have enough money to buy some  so plz PLZ make the gems cost less like 340 gems cost half the price cuz if you made it that EVEYONE would buy gems so please keep this in mind      
Overall great game but it can be grind at times to get powerups and new characters. Also sometimes I cant sign into my supercell ID  but other than that  its a great game.      
This is one of the best game I found. I like this game more than free fire  the brawler are very cool and nice looking I love all the evolution and it us keep evolving also.       
Game is best and creators care for the players which I love most but there is bit of partiality between non premium and premium on basis of box opening loot I would request creator to make note of it also we get a very less amount of premium currency.        
Ok the game is amazing but the only thing that i dont like is that theres no report system because SO many people team sometimes its me vs 2 other people and they team so then i die and they dont even fight they just stay there going in circles like morons        
This game most of the timea keeps lagging.When i play matches halfway  it keeps lagging.The matchmaking takes abit long sometimes.This game is still okay... The difficulty to win is quite hard .clash royale is a better game in my opinion.       
I love this game ever the day it came out so that was me s fee years ago but I still love this game but there is a problem that is sometimes even st full hp I just die I hope you can fix that please but keep up the good work        
This game is fun and addictive. It has sleek and appealing graphics with plenty of engaging unique characters with awesome special skills. Team work will do the fun.        
Very fun  you get to like blue thinks and people up  there are so many possibilities  and winning is just really fun and makes you proud.

I will say this again and again until you properly address the problem and fix it. fix. your. matchmaking. I dont care about the search for team. fix it properly. everyone keeps complaining but you ignore it. 1 star        
Fun game. good for a quick pick up game when waiting. Theres plenty of variety in brawlers and game modes. Needs a report button for players who throw games in the ranked mode and POWER LEAGUE SHOULD NOT ALLOW CHARACTERS THAT ARE NOT FULLY UPGRADED.        
Great game but I had account one time  but something messed up and i just could get back in so I lost progress  and money that put on to that account. Again great game but there are account problems      
I am using 4G network but when I am playing this game   its like I am using 2G network always lagging due to network. This game is not fully use my 4G network even though my network gives 35 to 40 MBPS speed.       
I feel like the majority of the game are filled with bots that gets harder each time u rank up. The reason is that I would keep getting majority of the win yet I am such high rank if u understand what Im saying.        
Love it  but it becomes much harder to find players for matches as you advance in rank  as there are not enough highranking players to quickly fill a match with 10 players.      
When it was released global is when I fell in love with it. Over the past time I have become much better. Amazing graphics! Awesome brawlers! And much more. Play now Master Usertree        
I love this game. It is amazing and I highly recommend it. The only downside is the teaming. It is unfair. You vs and get teamed with WAY higher ranks than you. Overall it is a amazing game and I highly recommend it .        
It was good before but nowthe devs are making good updates  they are introducing new modes  they are making more skins  they are also making more F2P content and they are making more starr park lore and brawlers related to it  it was good before but now its one of the best    
Love this game! It should keep moving in the direction that its headed and improve on that  the characters are interesting and the maps are original.       
Ok  I like this game. Its fun and stuff. However  I dont like how in showdown  you lose one trophy if you die. Im not sure if that was a smart decision. When I watched brawl talk  I hated this idea. Everything else  for now  is good. All except showdown plus.  
Its a very good game but very boring if you are free to play. Couldnt get a single legendary after playing 300 hours. It used to be not really p2p but now its very p2p with the battle pass.        
The matchmaking of the players is oftentimes not fair. It will only make you mad cuz some players are not playing seriously. Lastly  there are times that the game lags and freezes.        
Its super super good  its not type of game that common  its exiting. But i have good wifi but brawl stars had a problem when it comes to signal. Thats why i give it 4 stars.      
Ver good game... But i am having some problem... On loading screen... After this update... Its stuck on connecting to server and then try Again... After i click try Again.. I got out off the game! I need some help        
Pros fun  free  good  and most importantly  No freaking forced ads! Amazing! Cons Grindy  a small bit pay to win but still better then most mobile games nowadays anyway!

Really good i personaly enjoy it a lot but there is something that bothers me nerfs and buffs as soon as people find something good about a brawler it gets nerfed and buffs anoy me becouse they buff bad and common brawlers and this kind of brawlers become really anoying anyway this game is awsome!        
In this game  the network is so slow even enemies could also get a easy chance to kill me. Brawl stars should create a system that all players start at one time.BUT I like the game.so I gave 5.      
This game just keeps getting more annoying to play  it just wont stop getting harder to level up and the pass wont give me fun and rewarding quests to do  like I got this bomb guy who can attack over walls and Id like a quest to challenge me to see if Id like playing him in the future  but quest...Full ReviewThis game just keeps getting more annoying to play  it just wont stop getting harder to level up and the pass wont give me fun and rewarding quests to do  like I got this bomb guy who can attack over walls and Id like a quest to challenge me to see if Id like playing him in the future  but quest are more like stub your toe on furniture as bull 10000 times for the millionth time and it just got boring and frustrating I have 15 brawlers to chose from but the game only rewards me for playing4

In power league  it needs to make it so that even if u leave in the actual games  then u still get banned. I have had so many teammates that just left. Thanks cuz everything else is good      
The game is really good ive been playing it for almost a year but some of the issues are that the match making is unbalanced and rn there is a glitch when i try to log in with my supercell ID it bugs and says invalid code pls fix this.        
This game is good very good acually i have been playing since 2019 and i dont want to be banned just cuz of a crash when i am playing power leauge Hey i found another bug when the update came so the bug is in brawl ball both in map maker and real matches it will randomly score not giving any points ...Full ReviewThis game is good very good acually i have been playing since 2019 and i dont want to be banned just cuz of a crash when i am playing power leauge Hey i found another bug when the update came so the bug is in brawl ball both in map maker and real matches it will randomly score not giving any points to both teams it will also destroy the spawnables spikes cactus and more and yes surge will lose lose his upgrades it is fixed by the time i edited this but the size got larger and i cant update.        
The game is fun but the main problem with the game is that when the game gets new updates it often crashes and doesnt work well so thats why this game gets 3 star instead of 5        
Annoying internet connection. Dont let me enter the match most of the time. I have a good connection and play other games too. This only happen with your game. I lost a lot of trophy because of this.        
The more you play the more you understand how boring this game can get but then you will stop playing and then continue and grind just like I did. Play fortnite its better and also play bloons td normal and the td 6 its better but for 5        
The free pass u need tokens to get them But y do they have u need gems?? Its realy realy good in the free pass I hate this. Lag... I love this game but Not much. This is y i give it a four stars I also hate it and i also sing is. I like The brawler (bibi)        
Probably the best F2P mobile game that exists  no joke. Genuine fun  and theres no limits on playtime. You will progress a bit faster if you pay  but its unnecessary and the game is fun even free.

I have enjoyed every bit of game play. once I found out about clash Royale  I loved supercell  and this was another great game by none other by supercell and its awsome. I cant wait to see what else this game has to offer!    
Very good game but now you can only collect gems from brawl which 90 per season or you have to buy it with real money so super cell made this change you can get from boxes so it will be more fun.        
This is a really good game! Only four stars because they havent done anything with clubs yet  and they say theyll decrease the club members to 30 from 100 when they do.       
This game used to be very fun but has slowly become more of a paytowin game. It suffers from huge imbalances in the characters and the matchmaking isnt good at all.        
This game is amazing but the reason I am giving it a one star cause I dont know why I never get good brawlers but I still love it and another reason is whenever I play championship brawl stars got a soul rivalry with me I always get afk teammates everytime this is the worst game made the worst game        
Its fun  but once you play the game long enough showdown is unplayable. Matchmaking takes 25 minutes and then you dont even get to play as there are teamers who make it unplayable. The new showdown does not help with this       
Its great and fun. Im lvl 133 currently and i will admit its kind of annoying how much you need to grind to get a legendary brawler but in the end its worth it. Keep up the epic work devs!        
Wonderful game kid friendly and very entertaining I would highly recommend this best game ever . Its so fun and you will never get bored of it. You should definitely download this game.        
This app is great and I have played for 2 years. In this game everything is very much good but the only thing I dont like is the network system. If its slightly slow it doesnt work so supercell please remove the thing.

If your wondering bronze 1 power league? Well not  its gold 1 apparently. Its not high but most of average players are in gold. The gameplay is pretty good but if you play with random players its      
This is A Fun Game Heres Why You Need To Play A Match to Get A Brawler Sometimes you lag and they fixed teaming soo its not unfair gem grab is some times hard you need to think about your next move make sure to save up your gems for a brawl pass after that get a skin.        
Had given 1 star as i had 3 problems which are all solved! Thank you supercell! This is an amazing game.. keep up the good work and thank you for this game!! Best of all. I really recommend this for playing.. EXTREMELY FUN!!!!!        
Very good game but this week Ive been bombarded by teammers in showdown().If you can  please ban them and it would be very helpful if you added a raport button (not only in clubs)     
Brawl stars is an amazing  one of its kind game. Its fun  every session gives an unique experience. The brawl modes are fun  brawlers are exciting  overall an amazing game.    
Fun to play. Its not pay to win. All the different brawlers make it better because they are all good for something. The biggest problem is you need really good wifi connection.        
I really love this game I would say this game will be ur favorite soon I kinda was not having fun when I started then over I became a big fan I really suggest u to play it they have a lot of gammodes that are fun but playing this too much gets me a bit bored        
Its good game I love playing this game and thay also did something to stop teaming . but why I am giving this game 3 stars bc matchmaking I am at 15k and I match with 20 to 30k thats a lot different. You need to do something about that

A lot of internet connection problems although I am on 100Mb connection and no other appgame has problem with it. In addition to that  the game always glitches making the brawler moves in one line  no matter where i am pressing or to which direction. Apart from the last update  game is fine but it has two big problems. Players who are trolling  they just enter a team game and start making stupid moves. Other problem is some brawlers need to be nerfed (e.g. Edgar).  
This is actually awesome . If u are searching for a new PvP game this is for you . First when I saw this I thought it will be boring and the players are too small . When I download and see it it actually fascinates me        
Really really really great. Its just too good to not to be played I love the FACT that you can get every second brawl pass for FREE. Love this game. And try it out your self.         
I think the best feature in the game is the ability to choose. There are so many different brawlers and game modes  who makes the game fun for everyone  even if they dont like one of the playstiles the game offers.      
I love the game its so great you can play with friends and that it is way better and less violent then Fortnite and a better substitute you should download it but I wish there was I higher percentage of getting different characters.

I really like this game but there is one big problem I am facing   in this game I am on more than 8000 trophies and I still have 22 brawlers   while my sister is on 4000 trophies and she has 21 brawlers which is totally not fair . Please help me get more brawlers.      
Best game in the shop. The most games died but this one dont. I think its cool becouse you do not need much time to play and you can play it everywhere. Do not think  install       
One of the best games on mobile. The concept is simple and yet  it is one that hooks you on  enough to not get you addictied. Best thing is that you dont need to spend a single penny to be a good player in this game.

Great fighting mechanisms and great offense and defense characters overall this game is probably one of the bestest games Ive ever played and its really good if somebody says its bad they probably are braindead        
i love this game but when i try to play it on this device it does not work i really like this game and i have played it on other devices there are not ads but the fact that i can not get it too work is why i gave this app 4 stars.(       
I love this game! I can play with my friends! I have 3858 and 20 brawlers. I have some lucky. I dont really known why people say    I hate this game or    I dont like this game because i dont have all brawlers  but why they say this...?

Supercell will never set this problem even though it could be solved by adding a new ban system for this players. But  sadly  we know that they will never add this into the game  because most of this players are those who spend money in the game  and supercell is more interested at making money instead of making fun and balanced games. 
I was logging into brawl stars but it says check your network and try again later so i check and it was fine and i tried again and again and again but it does not work can u plases fix it i want to play brawl starsssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!        
Its a fun game but the new brawlers are just too overpowered and its extremely hard to lose with brawlers like squeak and brynn  it requires no skill and its too overpowered. The game is not balance anymore and its gonna die if supercell cant make balance to this game.

Hard time to switch but i got my old account back  Oh so you love this game Theres many types of heroes that you could play my you like it to  _ this game is very expensive but you can get gems for free at the brawl pass rewards its very easy to play

I really enjoy this game and it is very well created and props to the devs for being really kind and there are some flaws but the pros outweigh the cons  I would really recommend this  1010 D      
This game is super fun! I like how you get too play different modes  and play with others. You can join people as well  really fun!

Honestly we need some sort of report system cause Ive had people like this grief most of my games. Legit 1 of them were on a 17 losing streak grieving games. It ruins the value of getting higher ranks cause at the end of the day you gotta match up with other people instead of doing it solo really sucks now. All started with the pins in my opinion.

This game is great  with balanced brawlers and options for free to play and paying in the game. Unrandomised Power Points should definitely be more accessible as I only have 2 maxed brawlers.       
The best game in my life  but the problam is after playing 1 year my changes of getting brawlers is very very difficult  the changes of lagendary brawler are in points  0.335percent .Supercell has to fix it       
The players which have their pins turned off  whenever another player uses a pin the audio of the pin gets really buggy and sounds bad  which shouldnt even happen in the first place if the pin is turned off  other than that the game is perfect     
I am updating my review. I used to love this game  BUT suddenly no new brawlers! I am playing every day and opening brawler  big and mega boxes  I just dont get new brawlers. My family members get brawlers in almost all their boxes. Why?     
102619  Brawl stars is so laggy and there are so many bots and gemmers. (3 stars) Edit 61621  This is still true to this day but its definatly gotten a lot better so im changing my review to 4 stars.        
Its a good game  but supercell can make that when you play friendly game you can play with every brawler not only that you have  please supercell make it possible.      
Really great high quality game that has new unlockable characters  a pass with great rewards worth playing for  multiple changing game modes and more. Great overall.      
Good game... I have one problem after this update I cant play the game well I have good network but still it says that I have network problem fix this.. Before the update there was no problems        
Super fun i play it all the time and im sad that it was forgotten cuz after all these years its still damn good!!!! This game was my childhood and im happy i get to get back into it with all my progress.

Great game. Previously had given 5 stars but it has been lagging a lot every game since the latest update  please fix. No other apps are open  occurs every game since the update but never happened before.       
I thought that brawl stars would be ok  but a bit bad. But when I played it  I instantly loved it! It is honestly by far my favourite game EVER!!! I think my fav brawler is sprout.      
Fun as hell But is kinda sucks that the chances of getting brawlsers are very low i pushed all my brawlers tk rank 10 and 15 but withount a new brawler it is hard to push my trophys some more i hope supercell maybe increase the chances of getting a new brawler by a bit        
the matchmaking is so bad  I was a power 7 Rico with a power 5 emz and a power 4 brock and we got matched up against a full squad of power 10s. Since my last review I entitled not being able to get a brawler even thought Ive opened up over 60 boxes  its now become 90       
Nice online game.... But the match making is really really awful! Be prepared to play with bots in your team as well. Another issue in this game is the amount of troll players.        
I Love this game! Its really fun and you can play many games. But i kinda wish that the game will let us make our own brawler. So If you coulkd make this it would really tempt me to rate five stars.!!

The greatest mobile game I have ever played. So many different game modes to play and an ever growing cast of characters to choose from. Better than most 60 games

Brilliant game..smooth gameplaygraphics itz alwayz fun to play....only problem i have sometimes is the connection issue keeps popping up during battles itz not my wifi tho...coz i saw an heard it happen to many other playerz aswel...but beside that itz a Brilliant game     
Its like better than other game . Best thing is that in half of games there is brawl pass and other like in cr but in this you can buy brawl pass for collecting gems and every season you get 90 gems .        
I give this game 1 star cuz now it is lagging like every time I enter to a match. So please fix this issue (my net is working perfectly) but I dont know why it is lagging EVERY TIME and because of this I lost 200 trophies(without even playing a match)        
The game is cool  I play with friends almost every day  please add a new mode  for example  five by five collisions  I ask you not to abandon the game   
the game is good but whenever i need to uninstall due to school stuff and install again  my account doesnt stay even if I clicked the button for it to save my account. and when i enter my email account gmail doesnt receive it. i just dont want to log in over and over again lol

After opening tons of boxes Im not even getting gadgets of most of the brawlers. Do you have any idea how frustrating it is to see a player having 10k trophies less than that of mine but still having more brawlers than me. It takes a lot of grinding to take every brawler to 700 trophies with low power level.

Takes infonite time to connect with 6 people in gem grab. Always shows network error on screen inspite of 200mbps connection and me sitting right beside the wifi router. Lags and shattering motion. Game is good  but a lot of work is needed.       
I used to love this game . But now its been lagging a lot . Some screen error. I have reinstalled it 3 to 4 times. Alwasy network error. Dont install. Simple graphic game like this requires a lot of internet speed Thats ridiculous .        
I dont like the fact that I dont get new brawlers and Im hard working on this game! Thats not fair!!! Im opened many boxes in the last time and I dont get a new brawler!!! This is the height!!!

I love this game all the brawlers are very nice and the graphics are also good but the reason i am giving 4 stars is matchmaking if we take power 5 brawler then sometimes power 10 brawlers also comes in oponent.Overall this game is good        
Great gameplay and loads of unlockables. new stuff released regularly and creators obviously maintain the game perfectly. Great as a free game but Brawl pass and regular offers are 100 worth the money

Can there not be a report system or something  solos is just a joke past a point  its just people spinning hoping they get left alone to get a win  or is that what its meant to be?     
One of the best games Ive ever played you just gotta think smart Ive seen the starter characters like beat a team for advanced characters its pretty easy to beat anyone as long as you have good strategy

Instead of adding features to mitigate trash players ruining the game  they make a joke out of it with this Bad Randoms promo. Thats a slap in the face. They need to change trophies earned to be based on kills and objectives  not on wins  because too many players get high trophies without knowing how to actually play by hiding in bushes in solo showdown. 1 star for Showdown  
This game would be great if it didnt constantly have trouble loginning in and the only way Ive found to fix it is reinstall the whole game.        
Great game mechanics but what is annoying is that it gets better over time which means that new players dont stick around so people dont know how good the game is        
My framerate dropped after the update from 120fps to 60fps max. Its still 60fps even when I set my screen to run on 120fps. I checked the supercells article and my phone (realme narzo 30 pro) isnt on the high fps list  so was the fps locked because of that? Needs to be fixed.

This game is decent  you will struggle A LOT in later gameplay  New brawlers are ok  but skins nowadays are seemingly lazy imo  and the Meta just doesnt matter when it comes to these guys. Its become a damn cash grab  and the pathetic excuse of lore changes constantly  its ridiculous

The game is good I would suggest playing it as it has great 3D graphics with awesome characters even though it has some let downs the game is overall really good.

Powerleague is kinda stupid mostly since it glitched when my teammate was choosing a character and stayed at 0s left for them to choose so I closed and opened it yet I got suspended for 45m.        
I have started the game 2months ago with my friend. We bought battle pass at the same time. He got 4legendary  mythical heroes. I got exactly nothing in 2months! I have more cups  more gems than him. But I have no heroes! I dont enjoy the game anymore. Its not fair game.      
The loading screen keeps stoping at 92 always. When a match ends the exit button doesnt work. At match making players number doesnt appear on the screen. Plz fix these problems        
After playing for a few years I can say this game is lots of fun but at some point it gets annoying and you have to wait a while to progress and this game can really make you rage        
The game is so slow in connecting to servers no matter how good your internet connection is. Its so frustrating that you cant even properly play a single game

BS used to be fun  but now its absolute garbage.

Its super easy to get into aswell as there arent lots of cascading menus with items to collect daily like lots of other game. Its a really good  fun game. Id love an offline mode with bots or a story mode I can play without internet access  thatd be my one complaint. Keep up the good work   
Im still very happy with the game  but I was a little bumed when we still had to buy with star coins wizard brian after wining 30 ranked matches. Over all still very fun great work       
This game is really is really fun you should totally get it you will have some of the greatest times of your life there really cool skin but I think they should add more and thats ill I have to say but get this game

I understand some people go afk cause maybe they get disconnected but people leaving on purpose just rage me. Brawlers like amber is also to powerful even with the nerfs she got  spike needs more health cause he is way to counter unlike bea  piper or brock and his hit range is low and hit speed is slow making him easy to kill    
i love this game so much but sometimes i played against high trophies players and i dont like that. as example  my opponent have 8 bit which u unlock it at 6000 trophies  fighting against me who at 3000 trophies

I also play it on my own  teaching kids from all over the world that life is unfair and sometimes you win  other times an old guy comes and beats you on your favorite game. To be honest  I ve invested some money in Brawl Stars but don t tell those kids.
The game is really fun and you dont need to use money to buy the golden pass.The reason I gave this a 4 star it is because the oods of geting a new brawler in mega box is to low if you are unlucky you will get nothing in a new account.        
I moved it down 2 3 s because it is so hard to get brawlers can you make it easier. Also way to hard to get gems im realy getting annoyed but when you get a brawler this game is the best!!! But sometimes i think this game is realy  but for now im going with 3 s        
Its a good game with some really bad flaws. For starters  matchmaking is the worst so its a 15 min expectency to get into a match when you are high trophies. They continue to ignore the lag problem and Im sick of that. JUST PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD FIX THESE ISSUES BEFORE MAKING MORE BRAWLERS!!...Full ReviewIts a good game with some really bad flaws.

Getting rewards no matter lose or win very good system everyday just keep getting rewards play and win rewards not like u have to win every game to win rewards plus need more brawlers unlocked one random free brawler evrry month login for 30 days get a brawler this should be somethingh u know devs        
Amazing games sometimes theres just some glitches and most time it says and no WiFi signal even though the internet is perfectly fine and its also a bit hard to get other Brawlers        
The game is really fun i just played 1 month and i have 12000 trophies its really addicting and enjoyable . every update is exciting because theres a new Brawler and new skins sometimes new gadgets i would give it infinity stars  )        
So nice game i just love it   I wanted to give a suggestion that to make this game more comfortable to play and to publish new brawlers. Thank you

Terrible experience was going to buy a skin so I bought gems just for the app to glitch out and not give me my gems but it did take my money so I am very disappointed and I have contacted support and they have yet to give me my gems or my money back!

Game use to play perfectly fine at launch but now all it does is lag when I play. Other than that  it is a pretty fun game to pass some time on.

Almost 25k trophies really good game wish some characters had slightly more health and some other things but its really enjoyable and easy if you hate dying instantly hide in a bush the whole match you will earn trophies easily        
This game is fantastic fabulous and supereb i love this game and my brother my friend and my cousin is also playthis game and supersell is always launch best games like coc cor and brawl stars and etc and the last i m saying that i love and i enjoy supersell and also supercell games       
Very balanced. I am at 10100 trophies and i only have 2134 brawlers my chances are super high but i havent gotten any brawler out of the box since april last year. To make it even worse i play from december 2018. Edit i have 14000        
For a 3v3 its a nice but you arent truly getting far without money being spent. Unfortunately so  do keep in mind that if youre playing for free that you may be lacking against competition sometimes.       
great game concept but worst match making and team partnering. game is set up so you loose an have to spend money on a game that charges ridiculous prices like their other games. also be prepared to never get new characters unless you pay for them.

This game litterly changed life .. like when Im bored and I play this game its Soo fun .. tho one downside.. since Im f2p its kinda hard to get gems .. is there any way u could like put 20 to 40 extra gems in the brawl pass Overall amazing game!

I love this game  the great variety of characters paired with the beautiful cartoony graphics and amazing gameplay make this game perfect for all ages.       
A game I still play after 12 months. Great work guys and looking forward for more exciting map and characters. Oh do keep the gems affordable for the ticket purchase ya        
great game. I get board but. thankfully. I got this game. kinda get mad on bad randoms but. its still fun. hope to see more from this game.        
It is a good game but it can annoying sometimes but people dont give and keep going to rack up the brawlers it is still I would recommend it 100.

This is supercell best game of all time the problem is dead low chace of brawler and randumbs and also when there is a 6 i always think its a brawler but i will soon be dissapointed so they should add green 6 for gadget red 6 for brawlers and yellow six for you know and i woudnt be dissapoing

impecable gameplay and presentation  truly a masterpiece of mobile games. The matches are quick and funky. The connection laggs a bit.       
Balancing characters is not suppercells strong suit and the Trophy system is horrible Im constantly put with randoms that have way less overall trophies and its very frustrating specially when Im on a losing streak.I used to love this game but I have no more joy for it       
Matchmaking has always been a problem for the 3 years Ive been playing the regular updates r very respectable which make the fun even after playing the game for a long time        
I have an issue after the last update especially when i start move with the champions on any maps the movement speed keeps changing normal and slow like im lagging but my connection is good and im not loggy... Would u advice me to fix it?

To be honest after adding gadgets getting a brawler is so hard All tho my chances of getting a brawler is so high its always a gadget. And they also keep adding gadgets you have to bring this game a lot to get a brawler.        
This has to be the top 1 game. Its so fun I play 5 hours of it every day. You can play f2p or p2w  it doesnt matter if you spend money on the game       
Cool and awesome game although you can enjoy without money we dont get many brawlers for free. It takes NEARLY 3 months to gets a new brawler if you got one today.but the game is awesome

Excellent game  I prefer this over Clash because your playing as the character. Reason for 4 stars is any robot or metal character is far over powered atm.       
There is no reason to play this game competitively as you lose far more per loss than you gain per win. Overall competitive is trash.

Overall competitive is trash. You get a single troll or someone not willing to play the game then you get stuck in low elo matches. On top of that it lets people play with characters ranked less than 9 or 10 which is ridiculous in my opinion as you dont have access to gadgets of a star power putting the team at a huge disadvantage. So unless you are playing casually this game is not for you.        
Really fun game the 2 things I dont like is the matchmaking and luck that u need to get brawlers but other then that very fun game u can play with friends and they add new maps I really enjoy it

I have played many games in my life till now but this game is good for now end device too. So I will recommend to play this game. I dont know when my time will pass with the game.        
This game is getting worst by the minute.. Developers like to add AOE damage with no way to counter it  it all comes down to teammates are they spreading or stacking. If they stack just afk its the game design....

Great game i play it alot however the reason i am giving 4 stars is because sometimes the servers and matches lag alot and also that the chances of getting brawlers is like dead low all i ask is pls suppercell make the chances to get brawlers abit higher        
I am giving it 3 star because in candiatate maps only allow those players who team up not those who killed us everytime it happens to me when I play we cannot explore the map and see what it is everyone kill me so pls take this action .btw nice game

You open boxes and you might get a new brawler or upgrade for a brawler. Once you unlock everything but a few brawlers you literally only get normal coins. With a small chance to get lucky and unlock a new brawler. This game is unfair and is paytowin or payforadvantage. I wish mobile games would change the formula and quit trying to milk us for money        
This is a good game .But a very small advice to the developers that you should add a way to communicate with other teammates like short masseges or something .        
I like this game very much i have been playing from past two months and I really like it but there is one problem in store there should be ans option to confirm a purchase by gems please fix this by the way game is awesome

I HATE Edgar with every cell of me  and I cant go more than three games without seeing an Edgar. Ive lost hundreds of trophies to him. Theres too many edgy 13yos who think theyre so cool and slick playing as Edgar. Edgar alone has done a good deal of ruining the game for me. Played as Edgar when I unlocked him. It was miserable. I havent played as him since. Worst part  theres no good brawlers to counter him except tankers.   
Everytime i play power league i have randoms that dont do anything and everyone and the enemies are godlike in the brawler there playing and add a goddamn report button how hard is it to program that. This game also makes me want to break my phone when playing which is not a good sign        
Amazing just amazing!! This is my 3rd fav game ever. I like how you cqn move wherever u want to go fight and at the satrt it shows u directly where how and what we do.

The most recent update has ruined the game. You have to reload all 3 shots after you respawn. Now your team gets spawn camped and theres nothing you can do because you have no way of defending Update 922021 you now respawn with 1 round. Still get spawn camped        
ive been playing this game since 2019  and i had so many good memorys from it. i think supercell just added to many updates on the game  amd now it kinda doesntot make sence. soo  i think less updates would be better!     
The matchmaking is freakin awful  no sense of team making  how is it posible that a player with 23k plus trophies  get a team with players with 8k or more les trophies  that dont have the same abilities and the same thoughts on how to play a single match.

Been playing this for 2 years  very f2p and beautiful. The only bad thing about this game is that I lag alot even if I have good WiFi.       
Personally  I can sincerely say playimg this game provides me the most thrilling experiences ive had in years and it allows me time to play quick simple games in between moments during everyday life       
I love the game so much because it has so many interesting characters that you can find their skills and many different maps on it .Its just like clash royal but better so pleas supercell creat more game just like thizzzz boomzza        
This game is a wonderful game. I loved playing 3vs3 with my friends. Though supercell hasnt removed all of the glitches in brawl stars. Have fun in the game!        
I love this game but the only problem is when im playing when my internet is gone and if i come in showdown or second place i dont get trophies and when i lose while my internet is gone i lose trophies...

The dumbest amount of luck required to get even a decent teamate is infuriating. If game developers cannot even make a good matchmaking system on a competitive game I dont have even a single clue on why it exists. If only some other company had made this game before supercell  then it may have been good.       
Very good game so far my favourite game because the brawlers are strong and can Brawls Stars add a 1 shot kill brawler or a brawler that can shoot through walls or fly that would be better.        
I think this game can be fun in so many ways you can play with friends and you can search for people to play with or just play by your self and there is so many game modes and they update it so much.        
I like this game but the matchmaking socks and even worse in power league.The lag is very bad but only occasionally.I always play with bad randoms in 3v3 but in showdown I always meet good randoms and they always destroy me       
I really love this game as it supports mostly f2p and I also love the new feature map maker but I wanted to share my maps to all other friends so that they can play even if I went offline so plz supercell add something by which I can share maps

I give it two star coz like other games its PAY TO WIN.        
Its a really fun and addictive game. And the shop has some sweet deals for a good price! I have a few of my friends on this game and they are addicted lol

There are some brawlers that need nerfs like dyamike stun maybe 0.5 stun. When i play edgar and fight another edgar their range might as well be infinite. Also the low percentage of boxes other wise this would be a 45 star game iny opinion.        
The game is amazing. But my game is not going further its stuck on loading screen and says try again later. Plz fix this problem.

Love to uninstall this game!!!!    
Everytime I play no matter how good my wifi is it always freezes. This gets so annoying and has even cost me a lot of trophies. Its so annoying please fix this my wifi is perfectly fine.        
You pay money then after a while they nerf the brawler and it will be like other brawlers useless. This company is a money hungry people and boring employees hope they can read or they know how to read so maybe some fair changes will come

Nice game But Can u add some goods maps and some throwers brawlers But One problem  In Power league  Our Enemies coming more powerful  They have too much trophies From us  If we have 10k trophies so Enemies coming 2025k trophies    
Super fun game thatll never get old as there are many different game modes and lots of characters to unlock with unique play styles.

Everytime I try to load the game it says update available and forces me to the appstore. The kicker? I already updated it. And tried uninstalling and reinstalling it. I would give it 5 stars other than that  cause otherwise Ive never had an issue like this.       
This game has a big connection issues and is not resolved has yet i have played battleground games and other higer games and i have high speed internet and other games dont lag only games lags alot.        
It is a game where you pvp with Friends and other making new Friends you get cool brawlers that can boost you up and fun maps that come out every 24h  i will give it a 5star becuse it s not about wining its about having fun       
Great game   I wish we could recommend brawlers to our power League teammates for a better experience and communite with a live audio with our team to create better game strategies       
Hey Supercell  a suggestion here. You guys can try rereleasing older brawlers gadget and star powers.

So the probpem is rotation of maps and their durstion with which i am unhappy  u should change it like that the for a day  u get 8 hrs for pair of modes then nxt day the modes are rotated such that it dont reaming same as for yesterday    
I agree with people say there should be a story mode  i like the game so i hope they keepy coming out with great content. I just really wish there were a story mode and a backstory for every brawler       
Im changing to 1 star. Quests still auto complete progress and the AI that fills the games is still and issue. Just let us wait to find a match like literally ANY OTHER GAME.

Matchmaking is literally trash it is pairing as with a team with full power 10 brawlers while our team has power 6 brawlers. Really i have not experienced like this matchmaking . Fix this i will give 5 stars        
Its like the best game and always brings some hope and balance updates that make it more and more better every season. I would Really recommend to play this game and subscribe to their yt to. Thank you        
Cause it is a shooting game the controls are easy and there is no use of pay to win in this game and free to play has a lot of good things too        
I really enjoy this game but since showdown is filled with teamers and campers which makes the gamemode almost imposible to play normaly  and its the mode that i mainly play on. I hope that you can fix showdown in this update .810       
Very fun game   the only thing is that in challenges I matchmake with 1000 trophies and enemy is 38000 trophies so winning any challenge is possible and u dont get any skin or brawler       
It is fun I love the events and all the characters that there is you can level them up too and a battle pass and much more it has literally everything fun game has.        
Nope this update the shop new events I play on 0 trophies brawler and get super high trophies enemies cant log in more than 2 accounts I have to remove one everytime I want a to log in a new its super annoying!        
Op game. I play it  and I get real fun in it. Thanks to supercell for making it for us. Just add new features to fun it more. Thanks a lot.

The community is immature and toxic. Many players abuse and spam emotes to harass others and rub it in  they emote more than playing. Many players fixate and literally suicide just to kill 1 person while ignoring strategy and objective. Grudge fights happen all the time  players will tunnel vision until you both get eliminated. Lots of cocky players. Matchmaking often pits u against extremely unfair teams. Some heroes are useless.

Improve matchmaking  too many matches I join have lag making it unplayable. Sort out the Gen Grab campers  soon as they collect 10 gems they go and hide in bushes. Maybe add a highlight features that points out the location of the brawlers with the most gems  similar to how the Ball is highlighted in the football game mode.   
Great game! I love the mechanics and graphics. The game does occasionally crash  but thats ok!       
I love this game its amazing and has unique feautures but its getting kind of pay to win with all the thing you can buy like the battle passes characters and mega boxes.        
Great game I gave it 4 stars not 5 because if you want a ftp acount you are not in luck getting brawlers is hard. So ptw is probably what you have to do.        
The random matchmaking is bad  please play the game if you enjoy being matched with newbies  whilst the opponent are proper planned teams... And the system compensate you with 3 trophies after deducting you 7 trophies... Brilliant idea to make the game fair      
The app is cool and all but sometimes when I open the app after 3 days its says login failed please try again I retired 4 times my only option is to reinstall the app        
Please  add report system. At least for giving up. Sometimes I face teammates who give up for no reason  harming his team  a player can literally ruin every game for fun and there is no way to stop him.     
I like this game but only one problem doesnt work when wifi off and it cool me my freinds can talk together and it up to our privacy so In the start it was difficult but I got use to it

My favorite game  but there is few problems. One is that matchmaking is taking too long  and when you joined  teammates standing and do nothing with same problem  but the enemies is attacking.

Cool game so much to do addictate the problem is I got another account when the update came I couldnt update because of space so uninstalled and tried to log in back with help support but instead deleted my new account progress! And lost 6986 trophies         
Just literally one of the best games out there. and i love this game cause it has so many features and it kinda challenges me to get better on aiming which im terribly bad at. but love it i recommend u to play it when u get bored or if ur tryna impress someone with ur skilz        
It is a fun game but I dislike that there is no report function because I just ran into some one hacking he got his super so fast I did not believe it but then he used it three times rapidly        
Can you add the getting gems form boxes back  even tho I wasnt playing brawl stars when it was a thing. But I would appreciate it because I want to save for brawl pass. Thank you. Can you also make chat available to all ages?       
Its a great game made by supercell and no matter what you buy with real money it dosent get you much farther in the game easily in the top three favorite games I played.        
Too hard to get brawler  and gems. Gems r too expensive. Game wise  it kinda fun. But because of the brawlers and gems i can only give 3 stars.      
This is a lovely game but the update supercell is going to put about club is not good. Please dont decrease the club limit from 100members to 30 members.  Thank You.        
Fun strategy game that is great that you can unlock diffrent verietys of the game its a amazing game and this is one of the most fun games that I know!        
The Best Game Ive Ever Played No Cap..... I know this review is not long but trust me play it. ) Ive also been playing this game for a long time I just EDITED this review so dont think I have not played for a long time 1 st acc 16k trophies 2nd acc 4.5k trophies        
This game is so good i have been playing for 1 year now but please remove the feature which is Reach 400 brawler trophies to unlock replays if not removing it then why is this feature there? please tell

Nope. Still needs the update evidently. I have spent over 100 on this game and now I cant even open it. Thanks Devs. Might change my review if you fix this. Maybe.      
I rated this game a five because l love the skins and the level that the brawl charter go up. There are also some of the big mini games aka events and you can be firend with people and play with them I love this game you play it now please        
Im back at the game but its annoying that sometimes the quick attack and super button sometimes does not work  idk why but pls if you have something in mind pls fix this issue.       
I really love the game because there is so much brawlers to unlock. Through out the game you brawl and complete quests and have a lot of fun!!!        
Is the game lagging after todays update for me only or with everyone? The wait in the lobby is too long. Not sure why they cant make a match when only 10 players required to start a round. Gameplay is good.        
This game is a lot of fun. The variables from battle to battle are alot less predictable than many similar games.        
Multiplayer is broken  constant connection errors and laggy even with a high speed phone. Honestly  just get a fake multiplayer game. Atleast it will work.      
Great game. Good controls  variety of characters and possible play styles. Lots of different maps and modes!       
Fix the game plsss. I play ALOT of bs and I never had this glitch or bug in my game . But from the seaosn 5 update I got this wierd glitch bug that I get stuck in the loading screen so plsss fix it .Kind Regards .        
I loved this game at the bagining I kinda forgot about it but after that I set a goal when I found out my friend had the game and I kept playing it is so much and I would recommend if you get the get tell your friends about it        
Match making is worst.When you brawler is at level 3 you will fight with level 10 brawlers sometimes.It is very annoying.When you have 15k trophies in total you will have to fight with 25k trophies players.        
Definitely fun if you are a P2W player unlike me. I cannot get many gems  skins  brawlers and brawl pass because I am F2P and have limited gems.The battle modes and map maker are still very fun though.      
Awesome game but on on my main account I only have few characters left and I tried open mega boxes by getting trophys for 10 times and got nothing after grinding so long. This is 3 account.

The game is good and ad free if you dont get brawlers you should not be mad its is actually hars to run a popular game. And dont team that makes the game unfair.

Its a good game but Power League is broken  whenever I want to change my gadget  it kicks me out. Can someone please fix this?      
Epic game! Very fun. But its more fun with friends. I played this game for at least 2 years and Its the best mobile game I ever played.        
Its a very awesome game  there are many types of brawlers which is sick  tons of game modes which is also sick and awesome skins. Over all I loved the game      
Good only till a time  in higher level  if you are a F2P  then you will face serious problems... Sad  I cant be a P2W...     
This game is soo amazing I love it ...but whenever I play in wifi there is always shows in game that my wifi is low . ..I think there is a problem...its not happening to me only...        
I love the game so so so much but It has loads of bugs when u need to be focused on ur game and surely when you win 2 or 3 matches u wont be able doing s.th even walking        
Well im playing this game for awhile im enjoying it but there are few problems esp connection when u played 3 times in them one of time is in poor connection also in power league pls input report system so we can report the player who is inactive

Its not loading the download content for me. It keeps reloading and not entering the game server ever since the August 24th update. Havent been able to access anything. Its a really good game tho. Ill change my review once you guys fix this error.        
This game just keeps sending me home no madder what i do. Its not working for 3 months now pls fix this supercell its been going on its driving me crazy I cant send an email bc it wont load up. Pls pls fix this        
The game is in the new update  there is a drop in the frame rate in the game  knowing that before the update the game was very good. I hope to find a solution because I love the game very much      
This game is fun but i gave it 2 stars beacuse....i got a lot of brawlers from that happend but when i study and i came back from a game and it all started this game is not clear but i still like it anyways bye bye thank you3        
Best game i have played in my intire life I stared playing this 4 months ago and Im Still addicted with this because of the monthly updates and in each update there will be a new brawler thats crazy I Will highly recommend to everyone        
This game is overall good but some bugs here and there pls add vc so we can chat with our teammates.Very hard to get brawlers fix that.Thats it hope u have a wonderful day supercell...

BS game wouldnt recommend  I have been playing this game for 3 years didnt even get a single epic card I only got rare and common cards my friend played the game for 1 month and got 3 epics  1 legndary and 2 cromatics. BROKEN GAME.....      
Great game but teamer they ruined the whole game in solo showdown in 600 trophies all players are teaming and even in showdown and then I also have to team because if I wont so all of them are going to kill me        
This is the best mobile game i have ever played you can play this game in the long term and getting new characters is fun but i havent gotten a character since a month or two i have 30000 trophies        
The best game ever!!! I really like this game but when Im playing with Mobile every time there is bad network. \ But with Pc Its my rate. with not many words. I am saying The best game in play store        
This game is great  but it has bugs for my country. Please fix the internet problem so that it becomes 4 stars  5 stars

This is annoying when I have good Internet the game said I have no internet Theres something very Annoying when I have strong Internet the game said I have no Internet internet my trophies are more than 7800 trophies  Wow Ive got surge this is so amazing I played Surge he is super strong thank you       
This game is now terrible. I miss the days that I would be able to play without the season pass. This goes the same with other supercell games. Please  get your game up. Its not fun anymore and I miss tickets       
Dont spend money in this game. They dont deserve it. Its filled with bots emulating players and it will take your money while also tampering with progression. Its sad that gaming has come to this. Were all responsible but we can change it.

Its a super dooper 3v3 game ever it was gorgeously animated.But i have opened more brawl and mega boxes but i didint got any brawler so long time . So my rating is 4.5for this game.But its a FUNTASTIC game ever in my life.I was madend on this game.

If anyone reading this and thinking of playing it or not  I would recommend to try it once and you will be not able to think of any other game... Im playing this since it was global. At the time Im posting this  Im at 32k average trophies. The game in fact becomes very COMPETETIVE when you compete with high lvl. Love your creation supercell...this is the game which will be played for years and years to come. Keep up the hype work    
I love the game so much it has a lot of fun in it. The game is very addictive but I have a problem with the brawlers I have not been given any brawlers this season but I still love the game       
Everything else is great...just one problem many times the game shows connecting to server then nothing happens...why so... Editplease respond to the problem I will give a 5         
I got addicted to this game.i found scoliosis(curved spine) which i had from when i was born because of this game. How i came to know through brawl stars is.whenever i sit in the sofa i lean on thleft side and i sit in the sofa for whole day 9 hours

I love this game but every new brawler is very expensive for exampleAsh 100 dollars just for a brawler and you deleted chat and player are becoming toxic noobs dont ever get to win solo you shall help them too so bye.

The 2 things I wish they paid more attention to is to make the season pass longer because I always finish it weeks early and if they paid more attention to old brawlers  such as Mortis  who needs his reload speed buffed  
Best game ever I like most. It not take much time to complete a match. There are no bugs that I ever seen in this game. As this is the game of Supercell so how we find any bug. At last  best game ever played.       
Addiction to this mobile game never ends! One of the best ever created. Perfect graphics  great missions  cool characters  nice sounding  etc.    
Please  brawl stars please  I accidentally spam my finger in the shop and accidentally bought whale watch Nita  I have worked so hard for the gems and can I please get it back I dont want the skin. Please........      
It is easy to learn and exzlriating but now with all the new updates the game has become more and more laggy and it is making me noncapable to play the game        
A very fun game have been playing for hours  the game are short and you can play anywhere and anytime.       
Terribly unbalanced matches  especially in league or championship. My team has brand new players with low trophy counts while opponent team has all veteran players. Keeps crashing recently.       
Idk if it just my phone buggn but every time I opened the app since the update it shrinks my screen funny. Ill fix my review (thats insignificant) when this is fixed

Developers that actually care about the game often implementing community suggestions and that are very generous with free rewards. Game doesnt feel unfair to free to play players who can buy the Brawl Pass season pass 12 of the time for free. Well made  little bugs  quite balanced for both new and veteran players. Been brawling since 2018 and the games only gotten better. Thank you Supercell   
Most shittiest server  just too terrible for a good game like this  just because of the lagging servers Ive lost many matches  next time you give us an update do something about the servers instead of adding too many colors. The game is good though     
This is a competitive game with many different characters  each one with different abilities. Its a fun game with lots of things to unlock!

I love how you can change skins to! I highly recommend this game. Me and my brother have played this ever since the beginning and havent stopped. We have never gotten bored of the game at all in our lives. Whats cool as that you keep adding more brawlers to make it more fun! Good job! I love your games  including Clash Royal  Keep up the most AMAZING work!! Sincerely your fan for life    
This game is super cool . But the problem is that in the 1 season i got only one brawler ruffs that means one season one brawler we need to wait 50 season to get all the brawlers plz chk the problem        
Everything is fine with this game but at some point if you have no friends online and you want to play with randoms they dont give us randoms they give us random poops.        
Best game I have played in a while brawl stars is a fun combat strategy you can unlock brawlers from mega boxes and big boxes or from the brawl pass keep it up Supercell.        
One of best battle royale for mobile phones. Edit after the new update the game is lagging a lot and the battery is draining. Please fix this ASAP        
The game is awesome but this is super hard to get brawlers after u get a mythic brawlers so u might need to fix it. Then I will rate for 5 stars        
DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!!!! I was playing with a decent wifi with 3bars but it Still gave me the stupid wifi sign and i glitched out at the last second on seige! Until they solve this problem i will not be playing this game and my review wont change

It constantly makes you come back for more  it has fun and interesting concepts and on top of that there isnt any ads. There is a couple of key features missing like club wars and better communication but I have no doubt that Supercell will add those in the future. Allaround its a good game for all ages  casual and competitive players  a definite must try game.    
Brawl Star is a very nice game please add more Brawlers can give mega box or big box for free than the game will be more fun. And I never have a free gift like 5 mega box if can pls add 3 mega box at a gift inside than will be like can get some Brawlers and wont be so bored .        
Great game but a bit mysterious. I like how it is mysterious about the brawlers is that they have secrets.       
This game is the best game.Nice about this update that now everyone without any purchase can now access so many gems and brawler Good changes and bugs and glitches patched        
Not bad . Good game  supercell all games are best .this game are best but I have some lag issue in starting this game otherwise this game is excellent        
5 Reasons why you should play! 1. Multiplayer 2. Add and play with Friends 3. Chats 4. Emojis 5. Save up for brawlers )        
The game is good and fun and i play for years but the supercell id there are bugs  i cant sign in back my account.Please fix it i would like to give u 5stars )

But this game is ok its laggy if if youre not on the right servers . Ill change the rating when u fix the brawler system.

The second issue is lag there is only teaming stupid primos. This game completely sucks. Worst game of the year. There arw power 10 brawlers at the low trophy level. This game literally sucks        
Its fun and all the problem is the lag supercell can u please remove the lag and add a daily free gem reward for everyday when u log on u get gems to make it more better that would make me happy

Lots of character each with different power and frequent updates. Its unlike any game ever to be made  because there is a slowly unfolding storytelling of how the game and its character came to existence  which holds even old gamers and attracts new gamers. Each update is like new chapter to the bigger story of BRAWL STARS.    
Yes one star. I hope u reply after seeing this. Its not wrong that I love the game but the issue is the Supercell ID. The email in my supercell Id is not lost I have no access to it  so I want that it to be changed so that my game progress wont get lost. Pls supercell       
Very good game. One of the few great games that doesnt have ads or require you to spend money to play more.        
Well done Supercell. You nerfed the overpowered brawlers and made the game a little more playable...for now. You earned the 2 stars  but if you want all 5 you need to get rid of teaming. Besides everyone wants that anyway so..and no solo showdown  didnt really stop it.       
Love this game been playing for years  but ever since the last update I have been having connection problems.       
Epic game like this game is so addictive. This game literally like the best ones out there only the reason why it deserves t stars is because of it epic features and game designs. This game is amazing.. hope this game gets so much famous        
Very good game I  mortis all brawlers are good I think it could use new types of free rewards but everything else is really good nice gamemodes and graphics my favorite game          
I would recommend this game to anyone that wants to spend money to get anything good  its fun but after time its just boring and I know that happens to a lot of games but supercell doesnt upgrade it to make it any less boring  otherwise I have enjoyed the game!      
The game is fun and the graphics are good  but the matchmaking is not fair and the game is very p2w.       
It is good game. But have some internet connection problem because my internet is very good in all way but in it its go lag or hang.        
Very good download it yeah but add some more ways to earn gems and add a option to exchange something like in FF we do by winning a match.        
The game is good just one thing that could change is the matchmaking because sometimes you use power 1 brawlers and you get paired up with power 10 brawlers        
Like its just so fun when you play with friends and overall is a good game. But there should be a update where if brawl stars guess what letter your name starts with you get a brawler BUT YOU CANT LIE

Get lucky or get money or get lost
Great game but becomes boring sometimes when you have nothing to do and the matchmaking is also very poor.        
Its a good game has good graphics and controls  but the chances of getting brawlers are darn low so its pretty hard to get brawlers once u unlock a 30 or 40 brawlers

I love this game so amazing!!!But to day they sad or something there is an update or i dont know but i checked my updates there is no update there saying breaking news please Brawl Stars fix this issue thanks.        
unplayable anymore do you ever think about making this game playable again. so much lagging it keeps saying that theres internet connection issue and in the meantime my network is good and working fine.        
this game was good until now i loss 1783 tropies and also when you lose one game of power legue you go down half way and when you win it barley goes up.I have been plating for 1 hour and a half a only got 4 trophies.i spend 40 dollars on this?        
A good game overall  but power league is unbalanced  you win less but you loose more  wont really really recommend this game of you dont spend money on games     
I love this game!(and all the supercell games) but this one stands out you have brawlers and lots of hp 1010        
Best app ever  Ive played this app months ago and I really did enjoy it  different brawlers  rare  super rare  mythic  legendary and chromatics  I honestly think everyone will enjoy it. 
This game is good but it always have a servere issue matchmaking issue power up issue I want to rate it in negative but play store dont have that option. It is very annoying

The battles in the higher trophies make it so tense sometimes  although random players can be a pain. Definitely a must have game! But like almost all supercell games  the devs are slowly ruining it. Gadgets are fun  but ruin the competitive feeling. Any brawler now being able to counter any brawler. Hopefully the devs do a better job in the future  and not ruin the game.  
I have played since 2018 and I think this game is super fun but I found that after a few years more and more people have stopped playing so now it takes forever to load into another brawl.

Though you have put some efforts to stop teaming (Takedown) I dont think its helping  people are still teaming up and killing a guy whos alone and then fight among themselves. The winner gets more benefit but if we lose at last position you lose extra trophies.       
Fun multiplayer game to play with your friend and the best part is that there is no adds!!!        
Getting banned because of bad connection. Also went back to watch the game and 46 players are also bots and losing trophies because of brawl stars horrible server is BS see what I did there v        
Fun. Keep moving  keep shooting  move back when countdown starts  hide when you need some healing.     
this game is just frustrating. the matchmaking is trash  theres no penalty nor consequences for afkquitterstrolls. UPDATE they still havent fixed any of these problems       
Matchmaking in regular games is questionable.

You get qued up based on your selected brawler  which means you can still be in against a guy who has 30k trophies in total but only 15 trophies on one brawler so you as a new player will have chance to get dominated every game cus you are still learning the game. You will need 2.5 years with and 4.5 without brawl pass to have everything. Mechanics and ideas are great. Dont release skins for trophy road brawlers. Hero with flying ult.      
This game need very high speed internet connection. Without high speed internet connection you cant play this game.        
Ummm i dont know if this is just my phones problem or something but whenever i try to aim  my shot kinda glitches and starts autoaiming for no reason. It is really annoying and please fix this annoying bug       
Its the best supercell game ever made.i mean in a category like this its the best game I recoomend it to all but dont spend all your money in it        
I love this game because of my favourite content creators  Chief Pat  KairosTime  OJ  Lex  Rey  BenTimm1  Nat   Tom and everyone else from Tribe Gaming. This game is a great game
Good game  but sometimes when i playing theres any lag make me uncomfortable  i hope you can fixing that lags.      
The game is involved a lot I like it a lot I have been playing this game for about 2 years now and it had been always good to its players .        
one of my favourite games its so fun I cant find a game more fun on mobile but theres a problem I open like 8 big boxes a day and i dont get a brawler pls do something about this        
Good game till season 6 like after season 7 came the game starts crashing every 15 min k i played like that now on season 8 it crashes every 30 sec supercell can u fix this pls.        
The only good game supercell makes. Action packed  fun  high skill ceiling simple to pick up. Rank system sucks      
I recommend this game for kids AND adults. Fun game where you can unlock new characters and minigames. Please try I totally recommend

Nice The best mod is boss fights which is very best and the very nice thing I like tere is no adds and there very best characters and the update is very awesome so I give 5 star to bs

Its clear that brawl never even can be balanced . It really is like going through trauma. Also for the sake of everything for a year I have got nothing but coins . All this frustration is caused by this game . It is not a good idea to play this game . If anything it gives negative thoughts .

I played brawl stars when it was launched in India. I love to play this game. but you increase the price of gems. thats my problem. i wanted to buy brawl pass but 50 rs. price increase on every gem purchasing. please reduce that. i requested you to reduce that 50 rs. please

Just like that I lost 7 or 8 trophies . Pls nerf his gadget . It is so fun to lose trophies . I just wanted to play showdown but showdown is no longer a solo game mode its a team mode . Every time there are 4 to 5 people teaming . Showdown  has made it even worse because if you lose you lose 1 extra trophy so people team .      
I dont like this game only for one reason and that reason is so strong and embrassing that everyone has problems I am sure Problem is when we start the game it takes too much time to join players its so embrassing        
I love you gang looks like you get over to the new captain James  so you can kill people  but not to kill you  would like to like do dont do like open new life CHS yeah  I like a game very much  it looks cool in my eyes  I like the games  and yeah  thats all
A Great game you should get it but why did I put 4 stars its because my wifi is strong and Im the only one using it and it lags in brawl stars so if you can please fix that Ill be very happy thank you for your time         
Very fun high quality even my three year old sister play it only one thing when I leave a match with someone who I wanna play with again I got to friends but it dont that person name but the game is good

It lags on wifi for no reason  my wife runs great on everything else but it its network issue. Please fix this.

Fun times are ahead. Getting started can be slow  but if you stick to it the game can be rewarding.       
I really enjoying this game  it is super intense and you will need to use teamwork. Give it a shot!       
The game is good  but its basically power 10  win. And u cant even unlock many brawlers. The last 23 mega boxes I opened had nothing in them. Which is quite frustrating       
Good game but SUPERCELL management is horrendous. They force you to do solo showdown missions when its basically a gamble where you get 50 chance of winning.

Underdog  sometimes when its 2 power 10  1 power 9 vs 3 power 10s the game says its an underdog game (maybe its due to the brawler idk) but when the brawler power is very very diff there isnt an underdog match for some reason?? 2. Matching system  multiple times I had matched with 2 teammates with throwables (tick  dynamite) while the opponent has none?  mostly ends with my teams losing

Certain characters are betterworse on certain gametypes and vs certain other characters. If you focus too much on one dominant character  youll eventually be put against much more skilled players. The developers often tweak stats to help balance gameplay. If youre on a losing streak  youll be inconspicuously matched against bots to boost your confidence. NO ADS! 
This is to the creators  you do realize that Buzz makes this game not even fun to play anymore. He is way to overpowered and his stun is absolutely ridiculous. Ever since you put him in the game it has become less and less enjoyable to play. Thanks for ruining the game

I know I am a decent player  but to lose 6 games in a row because of stupid teammates is just ridiculous. I dont even know how some of them got such high rankings. They seriously need to take into account win rates to pair. I deleted this game once  gave it another chance  but this is too much. If you want to hate smash your phone  this game is perfect for you.   
Probably the worst game out there  even with level 10 brawlers is frustrating. Fight someone and it turns into a 2v1 immediately. Dead end game       
Love the game and how it works  I just think more items and brawlers should be put into the trophie road Besides that great game       
The game is so much fun  however  there are several problems with it  mainly teaming and toxicity     
Ha best game which needs very less internet to work the gameplay is the unreal the chances of getting brawlers and many more I m just soo impressed by this game        
This Game is already at God Level.And the last high refresh rate update take it to Peak.As my wish try to improve Haptic feedback and 4D vibration in the game and gameplay.        
This game is a lot of fun but as it has a ton of little addicting things in it  you might find this game taking over your life if you have that addicting personality type. The devs are constantly adding new content! I love the commitment Supercell! This is your best game yet  keep it up!      
I am working for 126 days to get a new brawler. And I didnt got it yet. Supercell makes very low chances to get new brawlers so it is almost impossible to get a new brawler. Please do something Supercell.        
Fun and fun and fun but I want you to add the star power and gadget glitch back to the game please.I dont like the lags in matches       
Great game but i have only one problem why cant we play 4v4 i have 3 friends but how can i play with them man please make give us a Option to change 3v3 or 2v2 or 4v4 Please do consider my request        
I literally love this game but the reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the text chat if you accidentally make an account under 16 age it will not let you chat

I cannot stand the new update with gear though. Also my luck factor of getting new players and star powers is clearly not as accurate as they say it is. Ive messaged them several times because for the first 8 months of playing the game my luck factor never increased. I always got the same pre written response and was pushed to the side. It wasnt until a update that the problem fixed itself. I still do not believe its accurate.        
I love this game a played it for 1 year and I have 10 773 trophies. I recommend to try this game you can play with your friends or family members .

You can prove yourself being the best. And it is also family friendly. Which doesnt includes any vigorous blood or kills. It is perfectly balanced as all things should be. It contains good graphics. And it has lots of updates coming every month. It is a totally awesome game. By supercell. And with lots of game events and many brawlers. Personally  I love this game. It is a great way to hype your gaming instinct. And also nonaddictive.       
Super fun and competitive game however the updates sometimes can become a nuisance especially when the characters get muted.        
Very great game. It gets boring after a little while  tho. But its still worth my 5 stars!       
A good game is like an abusive relationship. No matter how much it frustrates you and hurts you  you keep comming back.       
They need to do a bug fix update. They havent done one in a while some brawlers have a delayed attack sandy and ruff being two of them and game keeps lagging losing connection        
The game is good but you need to fix your match making it is not fair sorry for four stars the game disserve five but that is the only problem I found        
It is a good game and all but if you can raise the chases if getting a brawler bye a little bit more it would be the best        
Good  dynamic  interesting game. Love tournaments  skin challenges  game mode diversity... Cant wait to play power league )

1. Worst Match Making . 2. Slow Down on wall . 3. It doesnt have simple option of Communication with randoms.

I have no clue how maybe because the update was so large but I broke the game somehow when I play with mortis and use his heal its allowing me to also use coilled snack so Im using 2 star powers and a gadjet        
Kool game but i ran out of brawlers to upgrade and all the chests i got kept giving me the same amount of rewards whixh sucked the fun out of the game and earning rewards        
Lately  I play this game that so boring and not interesting. But after  I want to try it again  and I play. And then  I want to play everyday and be more interesting also after I update it. I really happy  Thank you.

All the brawlers I own are already maxed out. So i am not able to collect them as a result I cant make progress to the next rewards. If i dont get to open a brawl box i dont get any new brawler thus i cant make progress. Could you please make a patch for this so that people can skip their rewards if they want to. Otherwise this update will be just lame for maxed out players.        
I like the game alot completely perfect no ads are glitches that make the game more fun and because its always getting updated Thanks supercell        
This Game Is Really Super And More Games Map Maker And Friendly Battle Etc..But It Is Endangerous Game More Brawlers Come No Players Are Like To Play This Game.So Try To Takr Another Idea

I highly recommend this game as I have been playing for 14 months now .my only complaint is that it takes up to a month to delete an account and in that time you cannot use the game but apart from that it is fine. Thankyou supercell for making such a good game    
I got 5 brawlers this month and I am so happy because none has got like me.Thank you supercell.Hope brawlstars become a top game. Op game but I am not getting brawlers and I am waiting with patience.Nice game though but I want I am waiting from 3 months .        
Such an awsome game I am playing this game for 3 months but I only have 1 epic brawler they r not even giving 1 brawler which would satisfy me so when I asked this they banned my account for 31 days such awful supercell is dont download this game this game is a money eater        
This game is amazing. I would give it a 5 star but as u progress in the game  u rarely get any brawlers.the brawlers become twice as rare.       
finally   the day i can letgo of the dead game. funny matchmaking   one hit Nani   and hard obtained heroes. what a game. (honest review). good luck surviving .     
It is a good game but the problem the in mega box he give me that the presentage of getting legendary is 900 but I dont have any brawler legendary and I am 7000 trophies when I enter game all the are 15000 or 20000 trophies why I dont know        
This game is awesome no ads very fun to play.i gave it four stars because its a P2W game and the matchmaking sucks.its really hard to get brawlers and a lot of teaming.but still I love this game         
This game crashes the update and can no longer be opened. Ive tried everything  I cant do anything but try again later. I Uninstalled this game twice but all I got was try again later..

But there are many things to be fixed. brawl stars will lag and it is extreamly annoying. Also you must fix this matchmaking where when i am playing my 700 trophies brawlers  i would either end up going against with pros like 900 trophies to 1200 trophies brawlers which is so annoying that i cant beat them. i am 28k and i would matchmake with literal 10k to 15k people and rarely 20k above or 30k. please fix this or more OG Players will quit soon.      
Not as good as it used to be  New characters suck and unimaginative. Connection issues even w 5g ... once a season is complete there is no incentive to play for big boxes...it suckz now.       
It is an amazing game but the no signal error has to be fixed and it is so annoying that you have to leave the match cause of it even if my Internet is fine        
This is my game man i love it this is the best i appreciate it sup drc ddl the creators umm no complaints but you have to make brawl pass more easyer to get like 100 gems its fine oter than this no complaints        
Its pay to win if u are a f2p and will start now just dont the grind will take about 2 years then u start to actually enjoy the game its not bad but the grind is stupid        
I just wanna say  even after the season reset I still havent been getting any brawlers even after opening a bunch of mega boxes and big boxes. Where are my brawlers?       
very good game get everything easy with being good player and active player of club.it also shows to update game once more but good game.        
TYSM brawl stars for giving me Max. I had been trying for a load of time for max but i didnt get her. And then the once upon a brawl gift (Mega box) i opened it it flased with 6 i thought it was gadget but it was max tysm brawl stars        
I didnt know I like this type of shooting game where you look at the top and I love your characters and the ultimates is the best animated shooting game        
this is a very awesome game but im gonna give it a 3 stars because some times the lag is so annoying and when my phone doesnt respond well.        
Its 2D but awsome. I didnt expected this good by a 2D game. In simple words it is awsome.

If you have been thinking about trying this app  do it.. you wont regret spending your time here esp with the current team behind it.      
Amazing game. Either you have seriously changed dps of certain characters making them basically useless or you have opened up a way to cheat. Was a 5 star game.        
Brawl stars is really good and fun so I rate it 5 stars and the starters get one brawler then within 20 min u already have 4 brawlers I only have brawl stars for 5 days now but I am so pro.        
Good game but when it comes to update it was bad i cannot update it i already do everything u could but i still cant supercell what erong with ur game and also brawl stars has so many update so fast        
The game is good but some times when I open it it show me that login failed try again later  but my internet connection is excellent

I think change is should be to give 4 characters in starting of game so thats why I have given 3 stars.. and you have to make brawlers like with water power.        
Its funny game you lose trophies its bad but you never get tired of it special with the Crow characters in things you should try it        
Brawls stars in regarded one of the great game in the world to say. Brawl stars have great graphics quality brawlers and many quality gadgets and many quality star powers and many more.....        
This is one of the laggiest games I have ever played. They have had over a year to make theyre servers better but they still havent done it.        
Good game  but most players are just a bunch of brainless kiddos that dont even have enough age to own a cellphone  freaking randoms.      
At first I was having fun playing but then as I stared to play longer it started getting boring because is so hard to get a brawler and in so down there are always teamers

Nowadays they just keep adding more and more unfair brawlers such as Edgar and Buzz  which just make the game no fun because no brawler can come close to them without dying. Matchmaking has never been amazing and there are fairly regular server issues. Used to be much fairer than it is now. As for the people complaining about a game being paytowin  grow up...   
I really like this game my only issue is trying to push brawlers to high trophies at lower levels because enemy brawlers are mostly max power level        
The developers were very quick to fix the issue I was where I could not update. Thank you so much!!! I really enjoy playing this game.        
This is an very good app for children  nor adults! It very well made and i have no problem about this application. Thank you for making such a masterpiece.       
I rate three star because its beutiful game 3v3 but please update this game to 5v5 for more intense battle and its hard to claim gems ticket and please fix transform to High grapics and add new hero at more high animated hd battle         
Its a good game until it isnt  which basically means its good until the only way to get better is to start paying to win.       
This game is really good but sometimes the game always gives me the most inexperienced teammates but overall it is a good game        
How the hell im gonna play this game when there r non stop RED WIFI PROBLEM coming in the way! Ive done everything from changing place where line coverage is clear to using my data alone just to play this game but it just getting bad. The worse server ever! Uninstall!        
I started Hating this game after the Update It always have network problem even my ping is 50100ms and My network speed is super.I have tested my network speed.I use wifi and even My Bgmi Ping Go 30200 (Rareily).        
great graphics and smooth game play but some times kicks be out but i think that its a glitch with my computer.        
This game is very good l love it a lot but one thing that I dont like was its a bit hard to get gems

Adding new content is good but your doing it to often and I can only imagine balancing all now 49 brawlers is a nightmare. Iv been playing before you guys removed Ricochet and replaced him with Rico. You guys just need to calm down with pumping out content or else your end up dying quicker than you already are. Also there are a hand select of just stupidly op characters most notably the newer ones.        
Ive been playojg this game for just around two years now  and I still appreciate the game very much. Yeah the game is hard to master but thats what makes it fun on my end. The huge selection of characters  the luck required to get all of them  its a very good experience.

The best mobile game ever. Most people say that mobile games have bad quality. Then play this game. It will blow ur mind no cap         
The game play is simple but amazing and the game updates constantly is not pay to win and very balanced very beginner friendly         
i like this game very much .super cell is the best ever there is no 100 stars it will be i will give 100 stars.bring more brawlers .        
Worst Game When I open the game it stuck in connecting to server it load then Please try again later I hope Developer will fix it as soon as possible         
this game is very good but sadly it is always hard to get new brawler and there is bug or glitch.        
Good game. Brawlers has strategic element like which brawler can defeat which brawler. I would not fight a brawler which can kill me easily.        
I just like the mostly the brawlers like the game and you can make your own place to fight in this game is to good just like it!!        
I LOVE THIS GAME but why cant we get like a legendary i had spike and crow but i reinstall it leon or amber oh and i get 7s and 6s last time i got all 6s but bad brawlers so please fix that still great game        
Literally every other supercell game doesnt lag except for this one. You know when your servers arent good because you have to tell people to use an ethernet cable for the world championship. Its been 2 years and you still havent gotten stable servers for the game.

Add a dang report button for the love of Pete! Im tired of seeing throwers during the game and playing a 2v3 or tag teams in solo FFAs.

But while time was passing by I noticed that like every supercell game this game is super exciting and addictive and with time I became very good at it and now Im participating in tournaments and qualifiers every month. So again  very good job supercell .       
I am really satisfied with this game but the problem is when i use many supers like stu super my game lags weiredly please solve this because of this i lost many trophies        
Really fun but i dont like that you depend on other teams to get trophies even though theres solo It gets repetitive

I like this game very much  but I really hate when the connection lags. And worst of all  when my connection lags  I cant move  but other players can move. Please fix that problem!!! Finally  I really love Brawl Stars and all Supercell games. Plus  I know all the Supercell games. Theyre the best. )
I really like the game it has insane graphics and everthing is just cool. The game has really nic 3v3 modes and i love how the game is soo competitive.

I just want that they will add some kind of mode like in which there are 50 players all against each other that be really cool. The game gets uptaded pretty frequently so it never gets boring. It has a really big community which is unique. Supercell have made awesome games like coc and i hope they will turn this game into an amazing game as well        
Im sorry to say this but.. MY GADGET IS SO LAGGY THAT WHEN IM PLAYING POWER LEAGUE IT KICKS ME OUT IN A MATCH AND I KEEP GETTING SUSPENDED BECAUSE OF IT I CANT PLAY A SINGLE MATCH WITHOUT GETTING KICKED OUT Edit I wasted a lot of gems on Mega boxes and nothing ITS STARTING TO GET SO UNFAIR        
The most epic game which features doodle battles from a 3D perspective. Not intense but fun enough like rpg games.        
great game but i think when a player connects hisher acc to supercell i think that person should be able to message friends and if someone wants to block you they can        
This game really made me rage when i dont get a character but I love it after all it is all worth it and I will never unstill it in my holeee life and I think its a good idea to instill brawl stars        
please  fix the matchmaking. it says that the matchmaking is done based on brawler trophies  then how does a brawler with 100 trophies gets teamed up with a brawler with 500 trophies? Will it be possible to done the matchmaking by experience points.      
Great game but just too much teaming! Its really annoying how everyone teams so you guys should add a reporting button or if people team they should get 1 warning and if they continue to team they should get banned

Simple and short...the best game so far ....but some devices are unable to unmute text chat during games with friends

They either die in a storm or in gem grab die just in front the enemy with 10 GEMS! Thats really annoying since if you have bad teammates (which happens most of the time) you have to carry the team by yourself and play it 1 vs 3 or 1 vs 2. Plus it would be better if we get more brawlers. Its soo boring to play with the SAME brawler over and over all the time. Their rarity of getting them is too high!      
Its a good game and its fun but my luck is more insane I got a legendary instantly and a there should be a feture where you can buy gems with coins s please        
Amazing more heroes and more events and game modes and more coins takes to lomg to get them love the game carry on updating !!!!        
Terrible matchmaking. Compensate other players for having a dumb bot on their teams. Matching me with people who pick brawlers without star power in gold III is unacceptable.        
 there is so much of net lag even if I had not used my net from morning my phone is also 5g net is always 4g net why though I cant play it the other games like free fire pubg my net is always good but in brawl only the net lags very poor server brawl stars fix it.        
It keeps kicking me out  overall a fun game though  it hasnt let me in a few days. Doing it again      
This is one of me favourite games of android  is funny and you can take time with it  but i think the rate of you can grt a legendary brawler is very low  i hope it can low in a time

The only reason I give 4 is because the matchmaking can sometimes be unfair. I get it is based on the trophies of the brawler  but sometimes youll be matched with someone level 10 at 200 trophies when the majority are levels 36. Matchmaking should consider both trophies and level. Other than that  pretty good.   
I am very picky  but this game is just so good  so fun and some characters are very satisfying you should 100 play this game  it is much better than clash royale and clash of clans  which are both good games  but this is supercells best game yet.

I understand you cant make getting rare brawlers too easy  but as of bow it is too hard  and auto aim has ruined Mortis and the lower ranks because people ONLY use auto aim  remove auto aim  give players 1 garunteed legendary at some point in the game    
Great game  but it gets extremely repetitive. While the new progression system is suppose to give more rewards  it doesnt seem that way. First you have to play with all the brawlers.

Its a pain to get the brawler back to 549 after you get your 6 wins with them. Second is not a constant flow of rewards like before. Its really annoying when you need just a couple more gold to upgrade a brawler but you have to wait a couple days just to get it.    
Incredible  probably my favourite game of all time isnt pay to win  easy to make gems from brawl pass awesome skins

Showdown modes at 600700 trophies involve teaming  so instead of using skill to play  it now is just luck whether you win. I also agree with other reviews that some brawlers have been left behind now. All of the newer brawlers (excluding Squeak) have been considerably better than the older brawlers. TLDR Get some balance changes  fix showdown.   
One of the best games I have ever played.... So many characters  so many modes  play with friend.... this things are enough to make this game awesome      
Okay I like this but why is not gems in boxes? Its not good  uptades is ok  but edgar should get nerfed but serious game is good       
This game is amazing you play with your friends you can showdowns gem grab and a lot more things its one of the best games I have played and its free to play        
Bring an update which allows us to battle opponents with same power or maximum 2 levels above or below.We dont wanna have matches with players which have star power while we are have just begun with a new brawler.Maybe then ill give it 5 stars        
Pay to get characters. Constantly lagging lobbies and with all the other problems just not worth it.        
Its an amazing game I we can play with our sisters and brothers it has so many types of brawlers wow they so many types of powers too wow The best game         
This game is really good but when ever i play it shows wifi icon without any reson and it lags a lot please fix it as fast as possible or make this game offline please        
I have played this game with my friends for more than two years and i have had the best time while doing that and i think that this is the best game i have ever played so you should play it with your friends as well beacuse you are going to have a very good time while doing that        
Nice game i love it but it is so hard to get characters but it os so good i love the knock out mode and hotzone mode and do show dowen and solo showdowen        
Their server sucks !.I couldnt even play as I a getting in lobby and it freezes in some time .my wifi give me 20 ping on other games but it lags here due to their server .pls improve ur server Supercell        
Fun fun fun but wish they added a MOBA style gamemode because it would so much fun to use these Champs in a league of legends style 3v3 or maybe dare I say 5v5 o

Cant even count how many times I have been paired up against people who have higher trophies than me. If your not willing to pay for the OP gadgets  then good luck trying to get them from the boxes. The trophy league thing ending at the end of the month is a BS way of making you keep playing becuase they will reset you back so much for some measly star points  you might as well go in matches and lose purposely.     
Solo Shodown is full of teamers. My friends unistalled the game because of it  so now i dont play either. This game is dying.       
Like this game alot very fun. You should download it and there are cool brawlers with different abilities.

It could not be possible to make this pathetic garbage idiotic game worse Its that bad at this point if I had 1 wish I would use it to delete this game        
Another P2W game. Matching system is rediculus. One team with toothpick vs. team with bazookas. Avoid and save your time and money.        
its pretty fine  but it takes a strong internet connection to even use it  so 4 stars.      
Season 7 and season 8 are to laggy season i lag always I have been playing for years I played season 16 with no lag season 8 is too glitchy I lags always I cant push trophy I gave 2 star bc it was good game s16        
Wish you could weed out players who just cause you to lose trophies. Really annoying that at the start they go to a corner and do nothing.        
Make Power league mechanic more balanced and more strict for unserious players. So desperate and fed up just to rank up one tier because people play so trash. Its really unbalanced.        
I have played this game for two years and it works just fine  I really like it. It doesnt have bug and its smooth.       
Such an awesome game the community is awesome  the game its self is awesome and the game is often being updated so the is so much to do. I have been playing this game before 2019 and still playing 55 stars for me       
I like this game since i was 7 yo and it feels real fun and i download it again  MANY THINGS WAS CHANGED!!  good animations      
Pls fix random matching  im at 30k and i kept being matched with 20k which equal to 1k nowadays  and opponents are like 35k. UX is going down because of this. Matching got even worse.      
Great way to kill time and you dont have to spend money to win. It pretty much takes raw talent (sometimes luck)  at 34k trophies right now. Definitely recommend. It can take quite a lot of time to be able to get enough gold to level up brawlers to max even with the new progression system.

Although there is some balance changes that are sorely required. Overpowered brawlers keep coming out and ruin game experience. Many times the difference between a win and a loss is the brawler played. Certain brawlers are way better then others. Its understandable that its not possible to equalise the power of the brawler but preferably nerf or revamp certain brawlers that are too good? Also good effort pushing out brawlers every month. Looking forward to them!        
Match making destroys your account after a while. Even loosing 1000s games straight on purpose and you still get matched against decent teams with random useless players on your team.

Its a great game! It just take a lot of time to search players to play with otherwise this is a good game        
Worse update ever. Im hardly to move normally  and lagging when attacking enemy. I dont know if this game is not applicable with my device anymore. (Honor play)       
The game is very good but i gave it two stars because of power league. Some people in power league just troll others and you lose the match!!! Edit  Now there are less trolls and more events are coming back to back and I am very happy with it!!!!!!!

Teaming in solo showdown  the meta being an absolute shitstain when it comes to certain classifications of brawlers and the randoms you seem to get on your team are either just stupid or have learning difficulties. Brawlers like Shelly are trash and have been like it for months on end with no buff in sight. Seems sad that a great game is ruined by things that the team wont fix.

Its an awesome game  but i would love it if you uninstall it and reinstall that it saves your progress because it didnt for me (       
This game is so good but i playing i feel some lag in this game end my controler is have a automatic move but im not left the brawler is i cent control hes going to enimy and im lose beause of log and i hate lag or log        
That game are good but i hope that the controller have a lock mode its difficult when its moving everywhere.        
Its a fun game but i like skins but there pointless to buy them also i accidentally bought a skin i lost a lot of gems i was saving it for a brawl pass

Its a fun game but 90 of youre teamates are terrible at the game when im pushing my brawler my enemies get better en better but my teamates stay the same like when i play with a rang 23 brawler i really think that my teamates are 8 year olds that haf 1iq pls fix this it ruins al the fun.        
Game is literally unplayable after the Season 8 fps problems. Optional update didnt changefix anything either.        
Review bombing this because the overweight developers cannot get off their chair to add a report button or do something about matchups after having reported the same for the 5th time now. I hope the 1 star helps them lose weight in any way possible        
To be honest this game is good but lot of teamers but thats not a issue.. For me this game is very good hope it grows more (        
Super fun and addicting  love this game! The new updates are great and there are no ads in the game and very smooth gameplay for the most part. It can get pretty repetitive and I wish some of the limited time game modes would be in rotations as well as more unique challenges for the brawl pass.       
I Love This Game  Its A Must Download! This Is The Best Game Made By Supercell  Hands Down! Im 11000 Trophies And 12th Dec Marks Me Playing This Game For Half A Year Or 6 Months  Since I Downloaded It On 12th June And Its Also The Anniversary Of Brawl Stars So Thats Good To Know!     
The game was very unfair to all players since every lose game has a high deduction to your current points while winning will only gives you 16 points which is very unfair.        
One of the best Mobile games I have ever played.brawlers Are welldesined.game have a lot of different game modes to play with and its free to play.        
connection issues! Even when Im using a wifi router to connect and it ruins the game. Plus it needs a report feature for players that early quit or quit mid game

This game is a wonderful competitive game on the go. Gameplay seems simple  yet it has a lot of depth! If you like competition and MOBAs  I highly recommend the game. The game is very friendly to F2P players.      
This game is awesome but there is also mic option to contact The teammate but also the character given after long time        
After the new update there has been significant drop in fps and the game movements have become choppy.        
There are four stars because we cant report players which do not play in match and this game is pretty good and one more thing please add report option to recap for players

Really fun maybe a bit more easier chance to get brawlers but thats it really but its one of my favourite games        
Brawl stars is the best mobile game ever I play with my friends every day its fun to play to collect brawlers gadgets and more  thank you for creating this awesome game       
Overall  its a great game  very approaching and good graphics but need to fix some more bugs      
i thought that it will very worst game but it is a legend game i like a lot   but the luck is so bad I tried to make more than one account to take a luck  but nothing so try fixing this bad luck      
Great game to play when bored  Fast matches  great gameplay  and great character designs!     
I love this game but the lag is to much if it didnt lag so much it would be a 5 star

This game is amazing. From the graphics to the mechanics and gameplay. Highly recommend this game for anybody.        
Ive played this game since its came out and yeah Ive enjoyed it alot but for a f2p player its an extreme grind to get brawlers to a higher level (past power level) even more insulting when you see players with power 10 which are half your level.

Great game but there are some flaws. 1. The rates for pulling new brawlers are wayyy to low and It seems like I am opening box after box and getting nothing useful like gadgets are useless in most cases. 2.

The brawl pass is way overpriced like in other supercell games The pass is 5 but in this it is 10 for literally 2 skins and the newest chromatic brawler there are other rewards but they just suck so yeah that is why I rated 3 stars.

The Game Concepts Are great  but theres nothing to do if you reach a certain higher level  its getting more boring day by day
